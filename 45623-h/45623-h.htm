<p class="indent">The Old Maids&#39; Club was founded by Lillie
Dulcimer in her sweet seventeenth year. She had always
been precocious and could analyze her own sensations
before she could spell. In fact she divided her time between
making sensations and analyzing them. She never
spoke Early English&mdash;the dialect which so enraged Dr.
Johnson&mdash;but, like John Stuart Mill, she wrote a classical
style from childhood. She kept a diary, not necessarily
as a guarantee of good faith, but for publication only. It
was labelled &quot;Lillie Day by Day,&quot; and was posted up from
her fifth year. Judging by the analogy of the rest, one
might construct the entry for the first day of her life. If
she had been able to record her thoughts, her diary would
probably have begun thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Sunday, September 3rd:</i> My birthday. Wept at the
sight of the world in which I was to be so miserable. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
atmosphere was so stuffy&mdash;not at all pleasing to the æsthetic
faculties. Expected a more refined reception. A lady,
to whom I had never been introduced, fondled me and
addressed me as &#39;Petsie-tootsie-wootsie.&#39; It appears
that she is my mother, but this hardly justifies her in
degrading the language of Milton and Shakespeare. Later
on a man came in and kissed her. I could not help
thinking that they might respect my presence; and, if
they must carry on, continue to do so out of my sight as
before. I understood later that I must call the stranger
&#39;Poppy,&#39; and that I was not to resent his familiarities,
as he was very much attached to my mother by Act of
Parliament. Both the man and the woman seem to arrogate
to themselves a certain authority over me. How
strange that two persons you have never seen before in
your life should claim such rights of interference! There
must be something rotten in the constitution of Society.
It shall be one of my life-tasks to discover what it is. I
made a light lunch off milk, but do not care for the beverage.
The day passed slowly. I was dreadfully bored by
the conversation in the bedroom&mdash;it was so petty. I was
glad when night came. O, the intolerable <i>ennui</i> of an
English Sunday! I divine already that I am destined to
go through life perpetually craving for I know not what,
and that I shan&#39;t be happy till I get it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie was a born heroine, being young and beautiful
from her birth. In her fourth year she conceived a Platonic
affection for the boy who brought the telegrams.
His manners had such repose. This was followed by a
hopeless passion for a French cavalry officer with spurs.
Every one feared she would grow up to be a suicide or a
poetess; for her earliest nursery rhyme was an impromptu
distich discovered by the nursery-maid, running:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Woonded i crawl out from the battel,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Life is as hollo as my rattel.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
And her twelfth year was almost entirely devoted to literary
composition of a hopeless character, so far as publishers
were concerned. It was only the success of
&quot;Woman as a Waste Force,&quot; in her fourteenth year, that
induced them to compete for her early manuscripts and
to give the world the celebrated compilations, &quot;Ibsen for
Infants,&quot; &quot;Browning for Babies,&quot; &quot;Carlyle for the Cradle,&quot;
&quot;Newman for the Nursery,&quot; &quot;Leopardi for the Little Ones,&quot;
and &quot;The Schoolgirl&#39;s Schopenhauer,&quot; which, together
with &quot;Tracts for the Tots,&quot; make up the main productions
of her First Period. After the loss of the French cavalry
officer she remained <i>blasée</i> till she was more than seven,
when her second grand passion took her. It was a very
grand passion indeed this time&mdash;and it lasted a full week.
These things did not matter while Lillie had not yet arrived
at years of indiscretion; but when she got into her teens,
her father began to look about for a husband for her. He
was a millionaire and had always kept her supplied with
every luxury. But Lillie did not care for her father&#39;s selections,
and sent them all away with fleas in their ears instead
of kind words. And her father was as unhappy as his
selections. In her sixteenth year her mother, who had
been ailing for sixteen years, breathed her last, and Lillie
more freely. She had grown quite to like Mrs. Dulcimer,
and it prevented her having her own way. The situation
was now very simple. Mr. Dulcimer managed his immense
affairs and Lillie managed Mr. Dulcimer.</p>

<p class="indent">He made one last effort to get her to manage another
man. He discovered a young nobleman who seemed fond
of her society and who was in the habit of meeting her accidentally
at the Academy. The gunpowder being thus
presumably laid, he set to work to strike the match. But
the explosion was not such as he expected. Lillie told
him that no man was further from her thoughts as a possible
husband.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
&quot;But, Lillie,&quot; pleaded the millionaire, &quot;not one of the
objections you have impressed upon me applies to Lord
Silverdale. He is young, rich, handsome&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, yes,&quot; answered Lillie, &quot;I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is rich and cannot be after your money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has a title, which you consider an advantage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is a man of taste and culture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what is it you don&#39;t like? Doesn&#39;t he ride or
dance well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He dances like an angel and rides like the devil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what in the name of angels or devils is your objection
then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father,&quot; said Lillie very solemnly, &quot;he is all you claim,
but&mdash;&mdash;.&quot; The little delicate cheek flushed modestly.
She could not say it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&mdash;&mdash;&quot; said the millionaire impatiently.</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&mdash;&mdash;&quot; said the millionaire brutally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I love him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You what?&quot; roared the millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, father, do not be angry with me. I love him
dearly. Oh, do not spurn me from you, but I love him
with my whole heart and soul, and I shall never marry
any other man but him.&quot; The poor little girl burst into
a paroxysm of weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you <i>will</i> marry him?&quot; gasped the millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, father,&quot; she sobbed solemnly, &quot;that is an illegitimate
deduction from my proposition. He is the one man
on this earth I could never bring myself to marry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are mad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, father. I am only mathematical. I will never
marry a man who does not love me. And don&#39;t you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
see that, as I love him, the odds are that he doesn&#39;t love
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he tells me he does!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is his bare assertion&mdash;weighed against the doctrine
of probability! How many girls do you suppose
Silverdale has met in his varied career?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A thousand, I dare say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that&#39;s only reckoning English Society (and
theatres). And then he has seen Society (and theatres)
in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Boston, a hundred places! If we
put the figure at three thousand it will be moderate. Here
am I, a single girl&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who oughtn&#39;t to remain so,&quot; growled the millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One single girl. How wildly improbable that out of
three thousand girls, Silverdale should just fall in love with
me. It is 2999 to 1 against. Then there is the probability
that he is not in love at all&mdash;which makes the odds
5999 to 1. The problem is exactly analogous to one
which you will find in any Algebra. Out of a sack containing
three thousand coins, what are the odds that a man
will draw the one marked coin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The comparison of yourself to a marked coin is correct
enough,&quot; said the millionaire, thinking of the files of fortune-hunters
to whom he had given the sack. &quot;Otherwise
you are talking nonsense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then Pascal, Laplace, Lagrange, De Moivre talked
nonsense,&quot; said Lillie hotly; &quot;but I have not finished. We
must also leave open the possibility that the man will not
be tempted to draw out any coin whatsoever. The odds
against the marked coin being drawn out are thus 5999
to 1. The odds against Silverdale returning my affection
are 6000 to 1. As Butler rightly points out, probability
is the only guide to conduct, which is, we know
from Matthew Arnold, three-fourths of life. Am I to risk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
ruining three-fourths of my life, in defiance of the unerring
dogmas of the Doctrine of Chances? No, father, do not
exact this sacrifice from me. Ask me anything you please,
and I will grant it&mdash;oh! so gladly&mdash;but do not, oh, do not
ask me to marry the man I love!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The millionaire stroked her hair, and soothed her in
piteous silence. He had made his pile in pig-iron, and had
not science enough to grapple with the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean to say,&quot; he said at last, &quot;that because
you love a man, he can&#39;t love you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He can. But in all human probability he won&#39;t. Suppose
you put on a fur waistcoat and went out into the
street, determined to invite to dinner the first man in a
straw hat, and supposing he replied that you had just forestalled
him, as he had gone out with a similar intention to
look for the first man in a fur waistcoat.&mdash;What would
you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The millionaire hesitated. &quot;Well, I shouldn&#39;t like to
insult the man,&quot; he said slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see!&quot; cried Lillie triumphantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, dear,&quot; said he, after much pondering, &quot;the
only thing for it is to marry a man you <i>don&#39;t</i> love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father!&quot; said Lillie in terrible tones.</p>

<p class="indent">The millionaire hung his head shamefacedly at the outrage
his suggestion had put upon his daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive me, Lillie,&quot; he said; &quot;I shall never interfere
again in your matrimonial concerns.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Lillie wiped her eyes and founded the Old Maids&#39;
Club.</p>

<p class="indent">She said it was one of her matrimonial concerns, and so
her father could not break his word, though an entire suite
of rooms in his own Kensington mansion was set aside for
the rooms of the Club. Not that he desired to interfere.
Having read &quot;The Bachelors&#39; Club,&quot; he thought it was
the surest way of getting her married.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
The object of the Club was defined by the foundress as
&quot;the depolarization of the term &#39;Old Maid&#39;; in other
words, the dissipation of all those disagreeable associations
which have gradually and most unjustly clustered about
it; the restoration of the homely Saxon phrase to its pristine
purity, and the elevation of the enviable class denoted by
it to their due pedestal of privilege and homage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The conditions of membership, drawn up by Lillie, were:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">1. Every candidate must be under twenty-five. 2. Every candidate
must be beautiful and wealthy, and undertake to continue so.
3. Every candidate must have refused at least one advantageous offer
of marriage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The rationale of these rules was obvious. Disappointed,
soured failures were not wanted. There was no virtue in
being an &quot;Old Maid&quot; when you had passed twenty-five.
Such creatures are merely old maids&mdash;Old Maids (with
capitals) were required to be in the flower of youth and
the flush of beauty. Their anti-matrimonial motives must
be above suspicion. They must despise and reject the
married state, though they would be welcomed therein
with open arms.</p>

<p class="indent">Only thus would people&#39;s minds be disabused of the
old-fashioned notions about old maids.</p>

<p class="indent">The Old Maids were expected to obey an elaborate array
of by-laws, and respect a series of recommendations.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the by-laws they were required:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">1. To regard all men as brothers. 2. Not to keep cats, lap-dogs,
parrots, pages, or other domestic pets. 3. Not to have less than one
birthday per year. 4. To abjure medicine, art classes, and Catholicism.
5. Never to speak to a Curate. 6. Not to have any ideals or
to take part in Woman&#39;s Rights Movements, Charity Concerts, or
other Platform Demonstrations. 7. Not to wear caps, curls, or
similar articles of attire.  8. Not to kiss females.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">In addition to these there were the</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">General Recommendations:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Never refuse the last slice of bread, etc., lest you be accused
of dreading celibacy. Never accept bits of wedding cake,
lest you be suspected of putting them under your pillow.
Do not express disapproval by a sniff. In travelling,
choose smoking carriages; pack your umbrellas and parasols
inside your trunk. Never distribute tracts. Always
fondle children and show marked hostility to the household
cat. Avoid eccentricities. Do not patronize Dorothy
Restaurants or the establishments of the Aerated Bread
Company. Never drink cocoa-nibs. In dress it is better
to avoid Mittens, Crossovers, Fleecy Shawls, Elastic-side
Boots, White Stockings, Black Silk Bodies, with Pendent
Gold Chains, and Antique White Lace Collars. One-button
White Kid Gloves are also inadvisable for afternoon
concerts; nor should any glove be worn with fingers
too long to pick up change at booking-offices. Parcels
should not be wrapped in whitey-brown paper and not
more than three should be carried at once. Watch Pockets
should not be hung over the bed, sheets and mattresses
should be left to the servants to air, and rooms should be
kept in an untidy condition.</p>

<p class="indent">Refrain from manufacturing jam, household remedies,
gossip or gooseberry wine. Never nurse a cold or a relative.
It is advisable not to have a married sister, as she
might decease and the temptation to marry her husband
is such as no mere human being ought to be exposed to.
For cognate reasons eschew friendship with cripples and
hunchbacks (especially when they have mastered the violin
in twelve lessons), men of no moral character, drunkards
who wish to reform themselves, very ugly men, and husbands
with wives in lunatic asylums. Cultivate rather the
acquaintance of handsome young men (who have been
duly vaccinated), for this species is too conceited to be
dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
On the same principle were the rules for admitting
visitors:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">1. No unmarried lady admitted. 2. No married gentlemen admitted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">If they admitted single ladies there would be no privilege
in being a member, while if they did not admit single gentlemen,
they might be taunted with being afraid that they
were not fireproof. When Lillie had worked this out to
her satisfaction she was greatly chagrined to find the two
rules were the same as for &quot;The Bachelors&#39; Club.&quot; To
show their club had no connection with the brother institution,
she devised a series of counterblasts to their
misogynic maxims. These were woven on all the antimacassars;
the deadliest were:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The husband is the only creature entirely selfish. He is a low organism,
consisting mainly of a digestive apparatus and a rude mouth.
The lover holds the cloak; the husband drops it. Wedding dresses
are webs. Women like clinging robes; men like clinging women.
The lover will always help the beloved to be helpless. A man likes
his wife to be just clever enough to comprehend his cleverness and
just stupid enough to admire it. Women who catch husbands rarely
recover. Marriage is a lottery; every wife does not become a widow.
Wrinkles are woman&#39;s marriage lines; but when she gets them her
husband will no longer be bound.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman who believes her husband loves her, is capable of believing
that she loves him. A good man&#39;s love is the most intolerable
of boredoms. A man often marries a woman because they
have the same tastes and prefer himself to the rest of creation. If a
woman could know what her lover really thought of her she would
know what to think of him. Possession is nine points of the marriage
law. It is impossible for a man to marry a clever woman. Marriages
are made in heaven, but old maids go there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Lillie also painted a cynical picture of dubious double-edged
incisiveness. It was called &quot;Latter-day Love,&quot; and
represented the ill hap of Cupid, neglected and superfluous,
his quiver full, his arrows rusty, shivering with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
cold, amid contented couples passing him by with never
an eye for the lugubrious legend, &quot;Pity the Poor Blind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The picture put the finishing touch to the rooms of the
Club. When Lillie Dulcimer had hung it up, she looked
round upon the antimacassars and felt a proud and happy
girl.</p>

<p class="indent">The Old Maids&#39; Club was now complete. Nothing was
wanting except members.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="center">THE HONORARY TRIER.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Silverdale was the first visitor to the Old Maids&#39;
Club. He found the fair President throned alone among
the epigrammatic antimacassars. Lillie received him with
dignity and informed him that he stood on holy ground.
The young man was shocked to hear of the change in her
condition. He, himself, had lately spent his time in plucking
up courage to ask her to change it&mdash;and now he had
been forestalled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you must come in and see us often,&quot; said Lillie.
&quot;It occurs to me that the by-laws admit you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many will you be?&quot; murmured Silverdale, heartbroken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know yet. I am waiting for the thing to get
about. I have been in communication with the first candidate,
and expect her any moment. She is a celebrated
actress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And who elects her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I, of course!&quot; said Lillie, with an imperial flash in
her passionate brown eyes. She was a brunette, and her
face sometimes looked like a handsome thunder-cloud.
&quot;I am the President and the Committee and the Oldest
Old Maid. Isn&#39;t one of the rules that candidates shall
not believe in Women&#39;s Rights? None of the members will
have any voice whatever.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
&quot;Well, if your actress is a comic opera star, she <i>won&#39;t</i>
have any voice whatever.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord Silverdale,&quot; said Lillie sharply, &quot;I hate puns.
They spoiled the Bachelors&#39; Club.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His lordship, who was the greatest punster of the peers,
and the peer of the greatest punsters, muttered savagely
that he would like to spoil the Old Maids&#39; Club. Lillie
punned herself sometimes, but he dared not tell her of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what will be the subscription?&quot; he said aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There will be none. I supply the premises.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that will never do! Half the pleasure of belonging
to a club is the feeling that you have not paid your
subscription. And how about grub?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grub! We are not men. We do not fulfil missions
by eating.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unjust creature! Men sometimes fulfil missions by
being eaten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, papa will supply buns, lemonade and ices.
Turple the magnificent, will always be within call to hand
round the things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I send you in a hundred-weight of chocolate
creams?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Why should weddings have a monopoly
of presents? This is not the only way in which you can
be of service to me, if you will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only discover it for me, my dear Miss Dulcimer.
Where there&#39;s a way there&#39;s a will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I should like you to act as Trier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh! I beg your pardon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t apologize; to try the candidates who wish to be
Old Maids.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Try them! No, no! I&#39;m afraid I should be prejudiced
against bringing them in innocent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be silly. You know what I mean. I could not
tell so well as you whether they possessed the true apostolic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
spirit. You are a man&mdash;your instinct would be truer
than mine. Whenever a new candidate applies, I want
you to come up and see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, Miss Dulcimer, I&mdash;I can&#39;t tell by looking at
her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but you can by her looking at you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You exaggerate my insight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all. It is most important that something of
the kind should be done. By the rules, all the Old Maids
must be young and beautiful. And it requires a high
degree of will and intelligence&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be both!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For such to give themselves body and soul to the
cause. Every Old Maid is double-faced till she has been
proved single-hearted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And must I talk to them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In plain English&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the only language I speak plainly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait till I finish, boy! In plain English, you must
flirt with them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Flirt?&quot; said Silverdale, aghast. &quot;What! With young
and beautiful girls?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it is hard, Lord Silverdale, but you will do it for
my sake!&quot; They were sitting on an ottoman, and the
lovely face which looked pleadingly up into his was very
near. The young man got up and walked up and
down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang it!&quot; he murmured disconsolately. &quot;Can&#39;t you
try them on Turple the magnificent. Or why not get a
music-master or a professor of painting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Music-masters touch the wrong chord, and professors
of painting are mostly old masters. You are young and
polished and can flirt with tact and taste.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the poor young peer, making a wry
face. &quot;And therefore I&#39;m to be a flirtation machine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
&quot;An electric battery if you like. I don&#39;t desire to
mince my words. There&#39;s no gain in not calling a spade
a spade.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And less in people calling a battery a rake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that a joke? I thought you clubmen enjoyed
being called rakes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is all most of us do enjoy. Take it from me
that the last thing a rake does is to sow wild oats.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know enough of agriculture not to be indebted to
you for the information. But I certainly thought you
were a rake,&quot; said the little girl, looking up at him with
limpid brown eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You flatter me,&quot; he said with a mock bow; &quot;you are
young enough to know better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you have seen Society (and theatres) in a dozen
capitals!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been behind the scenes of both,&quot; he answered
simply. &quot;That is the thing to keep a man steady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought it turned a man&#39;s head,&quot; she said musingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does. Only one begins manhood with his head
screwed the wrong way on. Hom&oelig;opathy is the sole
curative principle in morals. Excuse this sudden discharge
of copy-book mottoes. I sometimes go off that
way, but you mustn&#39;t take me for a Maxim gun. I am
not such a bore, I hope.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie flew off at a feminine tangent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All of which only proves the wisdom of my choice in
selecting you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! To pepper them with pellets of platitude?&quot;
he said, dropping despairingly into an arm-chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. With eyeshot. Take care!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re sitting on an epigram.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 677px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;<i>Take care! You&#39;re sitting on an epigram.</i>&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The young man started up as if stung, and removed the
antimacassar, without, however, seeing the point.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind my inquiring whether you
have any morals,&quot; said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have as many as Æsop. The strictest investigation
courted. References given and exchanged,&quot; said the peer
lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do be serious. You know I have an insatiable curiosity
to know everything about everything&mdash;to feel all
sensations, think all thoughts. That is the note of my
being.&quot; The brown eyes had an eager, wistful look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes&mdash;a note of interrogation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O that I were a man! What <i>do</i> men think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
&quot;What do <i>you</i> think? Men are human beings first and
masculine afterwards. And I think everybody is like a
suburban Assembly Hall&mdash;to-day a temperance lecture,
to-morrow a dance, next day an oratorio, then a farcical
comedy, and on Sunday a religious service. But about this
appointment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, let us settle it one way or another,&quot; Lillie said.
&quot;Here is my proposal&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have an alternative proposal,&quot; he said desperately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot listen to any other. Will you, or will you not,
become Honorary Trier of the Old Maids&#39; Club?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; he said at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes or no?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall you be present at the trials?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, but I shall cultivate myopia.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a short-sighted policy, Miss Dulcimer. Still, sustained
by your presence, I feel I could flirt with the most
beautiful and charming girl in the world. I could do it,
even unsustained by the presence of the other girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no! You must not flirt with me. I am the only
Old Maid with whom flirtation is absolutely taboo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I consent,&quot; said Silverdale with apparent irrelevance.
And seating himself on the piano stool, after
carefully removing an epigram from the top of the instrument,
he picked out &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot; with
a facile forefinger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; said Lillie. &quot;Stick to your lute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus admonished, the nobleman took down Lillie&#39;s
banjo, which was hanging on the wall, and struck a few
passionate chords.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know,&quot; he said, &quot;I always look on the banjo
as the American among musical instruments. It is the
guitar with a twang. Wasn&#39;t it invented in the States?
Anyhow it is the most appropriate instrument to which
to sing you my Fin de Siècle Love Song.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
&quot;For Heaven&#39;s sake, don&#39;t use that poor overworked
phrase!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? It has only a few years to live. List to my
sonnet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So saying, he strummed the strings and sang in an
aristocratic baritone:</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie laughed. &quot;My actress&#39;s name is something like
Chloe. It is Clorinda&mdash;Clorinda Bell. She tells me she
is very celebrated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;ve heard of her,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is a sneer in your tones. Have you heard anything
to her disadvantage?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only that she is virtuous and in Society.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The very woman for an Old Maid! She is beautiful,
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she? I thought she was one of those actresses who
reserve their beauty for the stage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no. She always wears it. Here is her photograph.
Isn&#39;t that a lovely face?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
&quot;It is a lovely photograph. Does she hope to achieve
recognition by it, I wonder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sceptic!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I doubt all charms but yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you shall see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, but mention her name clearly when you introduce
me. Women are such changing creatures&mdash;to-day
pretty, to-morrow plain, yesterday ugly. I have to be reintroduced
to most of my female acquaintances three times
a week. May I wait to see Clorinda?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not to-day. She has to undergo the Preliminary
Exam. Perhaps she may not even matriculate. Where
you come in is at the graduation stage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see. To pass them as Bachelors&mdash;I mean Old
Maids. I say, how will you get them to wear stuff gowns?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The bell rang loudly. &quot;That may be she. Good-bye,
Lord Silverdale. Remember you are Honorary Trier of
the Old Maids&#39; Club, and don&#39;t forget those chocolate
creams.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="center">THE MAN IN THE IRONED MASK.</p>

<p class="indent">The episode that turned Clorinda Bell&#39;s thoughts in the
direction of Old Maidenhood was not wanting in strangeness.
She was an actress of whom everybody spoke well,
excepting actresses. This was because she was so respectable.
Respectability is all very well for persons who
possess no other ability; but bohemians rightly feel that
genius should be above that sort of thing. Clorinda never
went anywhere without her mother. This lady&mdash;a portly
taciturn dame, whose hair had felt the snows of sixty winters&mdash;was
as much a part of her as a thorn is of a rose.
She accompanied her always&mdash;except when she was singing&mdash;and
loomed like some more substantial shadow before
or behind her at balls and receptions, at concerts and
operas, private views and church bazaars. Her mother
was always with her behind the scenes. She helped her to
make up and to unmake. She became the St. Peter of the
dressing-room in her absence. At the Green Room Club
they will tell you how a royal personage asking permission
to come and congratulate her, received the answer: &quot;I shall
be most honored&mdash;in the presence of my mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There were those who wished Clorinda had been born
an orphan.</p>

<p class="indent">But the graver sort held Miss Bell up as a typical harbinger
of the new era, when actresses would keep mothers
instead of dog-carts. There was no intrinsic reason, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
said, why actresses should not be received at Court, and
visit the homes of the poor. Clorinda was very charming.
She was tall and fair as a lily, with dashes of color stolen
from the rose and the daffodil, for her eyes had a sparkle
and her cheeks a flush and her hair was usually golden.
Not the least of her physical charms was the fact that
she had numerous admirers. But it was understood that
she kept them at a distance and that they worshipped there.
The Society journals, to which Clorinda was indebted
for considerable information about herself, often stated
that she intended to enter a convent, as her higher nature
found scant satisfaction in stage triumphs, and she had
refused to exchange her hand either for a coronet or a pile
of dollars. They frequently stated the opposite, but a
Society journal cannot always be contradicting a contemporary.
It must sometimes contradict itself, as a proof
of impartiality. Clorinda let all these rumors surge about
her unheeded, and her managers had to pay for the advertisement.
The money came back to them, though, for
Clorinda was a sure draw. She brought the odor of
sanctity over the footlights, and people have almost as
much curiosity to see a saint as a sinner&mdash;especially when
the saint is beautiful.</p>

<p class="indent">Gentlemen in particular paid frequent pilgrimages to
the shrine of the saint, and adored her from the ten-and-sixpenny
pews. There was at this period a noteworthy
figure in London dress circles and stalls, an inveterate
first-nighter, whose identity was the subject of considerable
speculation. He was a mystery in a swallow-tail coat.
No one had ever seen him out of it. He seemed to go
through life armed with a white breastplate, starched shot-proof
and dazzling as a grenadier&#39;s cuirass. What wonder
that a wit (who had become a dramatic critic through
drink) called him. &quot;The Man in the Ironed Mask.&quot;
Between the acts he wore a cloak, a crush-hat and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
cigarette. Nobody ever spoke to him nor did he ever reply.
He could not be dumb, because he had been heard to
murmur &quot;Brava, bravissima,&quot; in a soft but incorrect foreign
manner. He was very handsome, with a high, white
forehead of the Goth order of architecture, and dark, Moorish
eyes. Nobody even knew his name, for he went to
the play quite anonymously. The pit took him for a
critic, and the critics for a minor poet. He had appeared
on the scene (or before it) only twelve months ago, but
already he was a distinguished man. Even the actors and
actresses had come to hear of him, and not a few had
peeped at him between their speeches. He was certainly
a sight for the &quot;gods.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Latterly he had taken to frequenting the <i>Lymarket</i>,
where Miss Clorinda Bell was &quot;starring&quot; for a season of
legitimate drama. It was the only kind the scrupulous
actress would play in. Whenever there was no first night
on anywhere else, he went to see Clorinda. Only a few
rivals and the company knew of his constancy to the entertainment.
Clorinda was, it will be remembered, one of
the company.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the <i>entr&#39;acte</i> and the orchestra was playing a
gavotte, to which the eighteenth-century figures on the
drop scene were dancing. The Man in the Ironed Mask
strolled in the lobby among the critics, overhearing the
views they were not going to express in print. Clorinda
Bell&#39;s mother was brushing her child&#39;s magnificent hair
into a more tragical attitude in view of the fifth act. The
little room was sacred to the &quot;star,&quot; the desire of so many
moths. Neither maid nor dresser entered it, for Mrs.
Bell was as devoted to her daughter as her daughter to
her, and tended her as zealously as if she were a stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but why doesn&#39;t he speak?&quot; said Clorinda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven&#39;t given him a chance, darling,&quot; said her
mother.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
&quot;Nonsense&mdash;there is the language of flowers. All my
lovers commence by talking that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You get so many bouquets, dear. It may be&mdash;as you
say his appearance is so distinguished&mdash;that he dislikes
so commonplace a method.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if he doesn&#39;t want to throw his love at my feet,
he might have tried to send it me in a billet-doux.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is also commonplace. Besides, he may know
that all your letters are delivered to me, and opened by
me. The fact has often enough appeared in print.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes, but genius will find out a way. You remember
Lieutenant Campbell, who was so hit the moment he
saw me as Perdita that he went across the road to the
telegraph-office and wired, &#39;Meet me at supper, top floor,
Piccadilly Restaurant, 11.15,&#39; so that the doorkeeper sent
the message direct to the prompter, who gave it me as I
came off with Florizel and Camilla. That is the sort of
man I admire!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you soon tired of him, darling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, mother! How can you say so? I loved him the
whole run of the piece.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, dear, but it was only Shakespeare.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you have love a Burlesque? &#39;A Winter&#39;s
Tale&#39; is long enough for any flirtation. Let me see, was it
Campbell or Belfort who shot himself? I for&mdash;&mdash;oh! oh!
that hairpin is irritating me, mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There! There! Is that easier?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks! There&#39;s only the Man in the Ironed Mask
irritating me now. His dumb admiration provokes
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you provoke his dumb admiration. And are you
sure it is admiration?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;People don&#39;t go to see Shakespeare seventeen times.
I wonder who he is&mdash;an Italian count most likely. Ah,
how his teeth flash beneath his moustache!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
&quot;You make me feel quite curious about him. Do you
think I could peep at him from the wing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, mother, you shall not be put to the inconvenience.
It would give you a crick in your neck. If you desire to
see him, I will send for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, dear,&quot; said the older woman submissively,
for she was accustomed to the gratification of her daughter&#39;s
whims.</p>

<p class="indent">So when the Man in the Ironed Mask resumed his seat,
a programme girl slipped a note into his hand. He read
it, his face impassive as his Ironed Mask. When the play
was over, he sauntered round to the squalid court in which
the stage door was located and stalked nonchalantly up
the stairs. The doorkeeper was too impressed by his air
not to take him for granted. He seemed to go on instinctively
till he arrived at a door placarded, &quot;Miss Clorinda
Bell&mdash;Private.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He knocked, and the silvery accents he had been listening
to all the evening bade him come in. The beautiful
Clorinda, clad in diaphanous white and radiating perfumes,
received him with an intoxicating smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is so kind of you to come and see me,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">He made a stately inclination. &quot;The obligation is
mine,&quot; he said. &quot;I am greatly interested in the drama.
This is the seventeenth time I have been to see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I meant here,&quot; she said piqued, though the smile stayed
on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but I understood&mdash;&mdash;&quot; His eyes wandered interrogatively
about the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know my mother is out,&quot; she replied. &quot;She is
on the stage picking up the bouquets. I believe she sent
you a note. I do not know why she wants to see you, but
she will be back soon. If you do not mind being left
alone with me&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
&quot;Pray do not apologize, Miss Bell,&quot; he said considerately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is so good of you to say so. Won&#39;t you sit down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Man in the Ironed Mask sat down beside the
dazzling Clorinda and stared expectantly at the door.
There was a tense silence. His cloak hung negligently
upon his shoulders. He held his crush hat calmly in his
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Clorinda was highly chagrined. She felt as if she could
slap his face and kiss the place to make it well.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you like the play?&quot; she said, at last.</p>

<p class="indent">He elevated his dark eyebrows. &quot;Is it not obvious?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not entirely. You might come to see the players.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so, quite so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He leaned his handsome head on his arm and looked
pensively at the floor. It was some moments before he
broke the silence again. But it was only by rising to his
feet. He walked towards the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry I cannot stay any longer,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no! You mustn&#39;t go without seeing my mother.
She will be terribly disappointed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not less so than myself at missing her. Good-night,
Miss Bell.&quot; He made his prim, courtly bow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but you must see her! Come again to-morrow
night, anyhow,&quot; exclaimed Clorinda desperately. And
when his footsteps had died away down the stairs, she
could not repress several tears of vexation. Then she
looked hurriedly into a little mirror and marvelled silently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he gone already?&quot; said her mother, entering after
knocking cautiously at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he is insane.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madly in love with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madly out of love with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He came again the next night, stolid and courteous.
To Clorinda&#39;s infinite regret her mother had been taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
ill and had gone home early in the carriage. It was raining
hard. Clorinda would be reduced to a hansom.
&quot;They call it the London gondola,&quot; she said, &quot;but it is
least comfortable when there&#39;s most water. You have to
be framed in like a cucumber in a hothouse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed! Personally I never travel in hansoms.
And from what you tell me I should not like to make the
experiment to-night. Good-bye, Miss Bell; present my
regrets to your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Deuce take the donkey! He might at least offer me a
seat in his carriage,&quot; thought Clorinda. Aloud she said:
&quot;Under the circumstances may I venture to ask you to
see my mother at the house? Here is our private address.
Won&#39;t you come to tea to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took the card, bowed silently and withdrew.</p>

<p class="indent">In such wise the courtship proceeded for some weeks,
the invalid being confined to her room at teatime and
occupied in picking up bouquets by night. He always
came to tea in his cloak, and wore his Ironed Mask,
and was extremely solicitous about Clorinda&#39;s mother. It
became evident that so long as he had the ghost of an
excuse for talking of the absent, he would never talk of
Clorinda herself. At last she was reduced to intimating
that she would be found at the matinée of a new piece
next day (to be given at the theatre by a débutante) and
that there would be plenty of room in her box. Clorinda
was determined to eliminate her mother, who was now
become an impediment instead of a pretext.</p>

<p class="indent">But when the afternoon came, she looked for him in
vain. She chatted lightly with the acting-manager, who
was lounging in the vestibule, but her eye was scanning
the horizon feverishly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this woman going to be a success?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said the acting-manager promptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
&quot;I just saw the flowers drive up.&quot;</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;<i>I just saw the flowers drive up.</i>&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Clorinda laughed. &quot;What&#39;s the piece like?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only saw one rehearsal. It seemed great twaddle.
But the low com. has got a good catchword, so there&#39;s
some chance of its going into the evening bills.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, by the way, have you seen anything of that&mdash;that&mdash;the
man in the Ironed Mask, I think they call him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
&quot;Do you mean here&mdash;this afternoon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Do you expect him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no; but I was wondering if he would turn up. I
hear he is so fond of this theatre.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bless your soul, he&#39;d never be seen at a matinée.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Clorinda, her heart fluttering violently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because he&#39;d have to be in morning dress,&quot; said the
actor-manager, laughing heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">To Clorinda his innocent merriment seemed the laughter
of a mocking fiend. She turned away sick at heart.
There was nothing for it but to propose outright at teatime.
Clorinda did so, and was accepted without further
difficulty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, dearest,&quot; she said, after she had been allowed
to press the first kiss of troth upon his coy lips,
&quot;I should like to know who I am going to be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Clorinda Bell, of course,&quot; he said. &quot;That is the advantage
actresses have. They need not take their husband&#39;s
name in vain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but what am <i>I</i> to call you, dearest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dearest?&quot; he echoed enigmatically. &quot;Let me be
dearest&mdash;for a little while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She forbore to press him further. For the moment it
was enough to have won him. The sweetness of that
soothed her wounded vanity at his indifference to the
prize coveted by men and convents. Enough that she
was to be mated to a great man, whose speech and silence
alike bore the stamp of individuality.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dearest be it,&quot; she answered, looking fondly into his
Moorish eyes. &quot;Dearest! Dearest!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Clorinda. And now may I see your
mother? I have never learnt what she has to say to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does it matter now, dearest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
&quot;More than ever,&quot; he said gravely, &quot;now she is to be
my mother-in-law.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clorinda bit her lip at the dignified rebuke, and rang
for his mother-in-law elect, who came from the sick room
in her bonnet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother,&quot; she said, as the good dame sailed through
the door, &quot;let me introduce you to my future husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><i>A Family Reunion.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The old lady&#39;s face lit up with surprise and excitement.
She stood still for an instant, taking in the relationship
so suddenly sprung upon her. Then she darted with
open arms towards the Man in the Ironed Mask and
strained his Mask to her bosom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My son! my son!&quot; she cried, kissing him passionately.
He blushed like a stormy sunset and tried to disengage
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not crumple him, mother,&quot; said Clorinda pettishly.
&quot;Your zeal is overdone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
&quot;But he is my long-lost Absalom! Think of the rapture
of having him restored to me thus. O what a happy
family we shall be! Bless you, Clorinda. Bless you, my
children. When is the wedding to be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Man in the Ironed Mask had regained his composure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother,&quot; he said sternly, &quot;I am glad to see you looking
so well. I always knew you would fall on your feet if
I dropped you. I have no right to ask it&mdash;but as you
seem to expect me to marry your daughter, a little information
as to the circumstances under which you have
supplied me with a sister would be not unwelcome.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stupid boy! Don&#39;t you understand that Miss Bell was
good enough to engage me as mother and travelling companion
when you left me to starve? Or rather, the impresario
who brought her over from America engaged me,
and Clorinda has been, oh, so good to me! My little
drapery business failed three months after you left me to
get a stranger to serve. I had no resource but&mdash;to go
on the stage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old woman was babbling on, but the cold steel of
Clorinda&#39;s gaze silenced her.</p>

<p class="indent">The outraged actress turned haughtily to the Man in
the Ironed Mask.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So <i>this</i> is your mother?&quot; she said with infinite scorn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So this is <i>not</i> your mother!&quot; he said with infinite indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you ever really simple enough to suspect me of
having a mother?&quot; she retorted contemptuously. &quot;I had
her on the hire system. Don&#39;t you know that a combination
of maid and mother is the newest thing in actresses&#39;
wardrobes? It is safer then having a maid, and more
comfortable than having a mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I <i>have</i> been a mother to you, Clorinda,&quot; the old
dame pleaded.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
&quot;Oh, yes, you have always been a good, obedient woman.
I am not finding fault with you, and I have no wish to
part with you. I do find fault and I shall certainly part
with your son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said the Man in the Ironed Mask. &quot;The
situation is essentially unchanged. She is still the mother
of one of us, she can still become the mother-in-law of the
other. Besides, Clorinda, that is the only way of keeping
the secret in the family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You threaten?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. You are a humbug. So am I. United
we stand. Separated, you fall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You fall, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not from such a height. I am still on the first rungs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor likely to get any higher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed? Your experience of me should have taught
you different. High as you are, I can raise you yet higher
if you will only lift me up to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you climb?&quot; she said, his old ascendency
reasserting itself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By standing still. Profound meditation on the
philosophy of modern society has convinced me that
the only way left for acquiring notoriety is to do
nothing. Every other way has been exploited and is suspected.
It is only a year since the discovery flashed upon
me, it is only a year that I have been putting it in practice.
And yet, mark the result! Already I am a known man.
I had the <i>entrée</i> to no society; for half-a-guinea a night
(frequently paid in paper money) I have mingled with the
most exclusive. When there was no <i>premiere</i> anywhere, I
went to see you&mdash;not from any admiration of you, but because
the <i>Lymarket</i> is the haunt of the best society, and
in addition, the virtue of Shakespeare and of yourself
attracts there a highly respectable class of bishops whom
I have not the opportunity of meeting elsewhere. By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
doing nothing I fascinated you&mdash;somebody was sure to be
fascinated by it at last, as the dove flutters into the jaws
of the lethargic serpent&mdash;by continuing to do nothing I
completed my conquest. Had I met your advances, you
would have repelled mine. My theories have been completely
demonstrated, and but for the accident of our having
a common mother&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; said Clorinda haughtily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is for myself that I am speaking. When we are one,
I shall continue this policy of masterly inactivity of which
I claim the invention, though it has long been known in
the germ. Everybody knows for instance that not to
trouble to answer letters is the surest way of acquiring
the reputation of a busy man, that not to accept invitations
is an infallible way of getting more, that not to care
a jot about the feelings of the rest of the household, is an
unfailing means of enforcing universal deference. But
the glory still remains to him who first grasped this great
law in its generalized form, however familiar one or two
isolated cases of it may be to the world. &#39;Do nothing&#39; is
the last word of social science, as &#39;Nil admirari&#39; was its
first. Just as silence is less self-contradictory than speech,
so is inaction a safer foundation of fame than action. Inaction
is perfect. The moment you do anything you are
in the region of incompleteness, of definiteness. Your
work may be outdone&mdash;or undone. Your inventions may
be improved upon, your victories annulled, your popular
books ridiculed, your theories superseded, your paintings
decried, the seamy side of your explanations shown up.
Successful doing creates not only enemies but the material
for their malice to work upon. Only by not having done
anything to deserve success can you be sure of surviving
the reaction which success always brings. To be is
higher than to do. To be is calm, large, elemental; to
do is trivial, artificial, fussy. To be has been the moth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
the English aristocracy, it is the secret of their persistence.
<i>Qui s&#39;excuse s&#39;accuse.</i> He who strives to justify
his existence imperils it. To be is inexpugnable, to do
is dangerous. The same principle rules in all departments
of social life. What is a successful reception? A gathering
at which everybody <i>is</i>. Nobody does anything. Nobody
enjoys anything. There everybody <i>is</i>&mdash;if only for
five minutes each, and whatever the crush and discomfort.
You are there&mdash;and there you <i>are</i>, don&#39;t you know?
What is a social lion? A man who <i>is</i> everywhere. What
is social ambition? A desire to <i>be</i> in better people&#39;s
drawing-rooms. What is it for which people barter health,
happiness, even honor? To <i>be</i> on certain pieces of flooring
inaccessible to the mass. What is the glory of doing
compared with the glory of being? Let others elect to
do, I elect to <i>be</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So long as you do not choose to be my husband&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is husband or brother,&quot; he said, threateningly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course. I become your sister by rejecting you, do
I not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t trifle. You understand what I mean. I will
let the world know that your mother is mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They stood looking at each other in silent defiance.
At last Clorinda spoke:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A compromise! let the world know that my mother is
yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see. Pose as your brother!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. That will help you up a good many rungs. I
shall not deny I am your sister. My mother will certainly
not deny that you are her son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Done! So long as my theories are not disproved.
Conjugate the verb &#39;to be,&#39; and you shall be successful.
Let me see. How does it run? I am&mdash;your brother,
thou art&mdash;my sister, she is&mdash;my mother,&mdash;we are&mdash;her children,
you are&mdash;my womankind, they are&mdash;all spoofed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
So the man in the Ironed Mask turned out to be the
brother of the great and good actress, Clorinda Bell.
And several people had known it all along, for what but
fraternal interest had taken him so often to the <i>Lymarket</i>?
And when his identity leaked out, Society ran after him,
and he gave the interviewers interesting details of his sister&#39;s
early years. And everyone spoke of his mother, and
of his solicitous attendance upon her. And in due course
the tale of his virtues reached a romantic young heiress
who wooed and won him. And so he continued <i>being</i>, till
he was&mdash;no more. By his own request they buried him
in an Ironed Mask, and put upon his tomb the profound
inscription</p>

<p class="center">&quot;<span class="smcap">Here Lies the Man Who Was.</span>&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">And this was why Clorinda, disgusted with men and
lovers, and unable to marry her brother, caught at the
notion of the Old Maids&#39; Club and called upon Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">It was almost as good a cover as a mother, and it was
well to have something ready in case she lost her, as you
cannot obtain a second mother even on the hire system.
But Lord Silverdale&#39;s report consisted of one word,
&quot;Dangerous!&quot;&mdash;and he rejoiced at the whim which
enabled him thus to protect the impulsive little girl he
loved.</p>

<p class="indent">Clorinda divined from Lillie&#39;s embarrassment next day
that she was to be blackballed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid,&quot; she hastened to say, &quot;that on second
thoughts I must withdraw my candidature, as I could not
make a practice of coming here without my mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie referred to the rules. &quot;Married women are admitted,&quot;
she said simply. &quot;I presume, therefore, your
mother&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s just like your presumption,&quot; interrupted Clorinda,
and flouncing angrily out of the Club, she invited a journalist
to tea.</p>

<p class="indent">Next day the <i>Moon</i> said she was going to join the Old
Maids&#39; Club.</p>

<p class="center">THE CLUB GETS ADVERTISED.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see you have disregarded my ruling, Miss Dulcimer!&quot;
said Lord Silverdale, pointing to the paragraph
in the <i>Moon</i>. &quot;What is the use of my trying the candidates
if you&#39;re going to admit the plucked?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am surprised at you, Lord Silverdale. I thought
you had more wisdom than to base a reproach on a <i>Moon</i>
paragraph. You might have known it was not true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is not my experience, Miss Dulcimer. I do not
think a statement is necessarily false because it appears
in the newspapers. There is hardly a paper in which I
have not, at some time or other, come across a true piece
of news. Even the <i>Moon</i> is not all made of green
cheese.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you surely do not think I would accept Clorinda
Bell after your warning. Not but that I am astonished.
She assured me she was ice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Precisely. And so I marked her &#39;Dangerous.&#39; Are
there any more candidates to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heaps and heaps! From all parts of the kingdom
letters have come from ladies anxious to become Old
Maids. There is even one application from Paris. Ought
I to entertain that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Candidates may hail from anywhere&mdash;excepting
naturally the United States.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
&quot;But what, I wonder, has caused this tide of applications?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The <i>Moon</i>, of course. The fiction that Clorinda Bell
intended to take the secular veil has attracted all these
imitators. She has given the Club a good advertisement
in endeavoring merely to give herself one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You suspect her, then, of being herself responsible
for the statement that she was going to join the Club?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I am sure of it. Who but herself knew that she
was not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can hardly imagine that she would employ such
base arts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Higher arts are out of employment nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there any way of finding out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid not. She has no bosom friends. Stay&mdash;there
is her mother!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mothers do not tell their daughters&#39; secrets. They
do not know them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there&#39;s her brother. I was introduced to him
the other day at Mrs. Leo Hunter&#39;s. But he seems such
a reticent chap. Only opens his mouth twice an hour,
and then merely to show his teeth. Oh, I know! I&#39;ll
get at the <i>Moon</i> man. My aunt, the philanthropist, who
is quite a journalist (sends so many paragraphs round
about herself, you know), will tell me who invents that
sort of news, and I&#39;ll interview the beggar.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, won&#39;t it be fun to run her to earth?&quot; said Lillie
gleefully.</p>

<p class="indent">Silverdale took advantage of her good-humor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope the discovery of the baseness of your sex will
turn you again to mine.&quot; There was a pleading tenderness
in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! to your baseness? I thought you were so
good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am no good without you,&quot; he said boldly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
&quot;Oh, that is too rich! Suppose I had never been
born?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should have wished I hadn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you wouldn&#39;t have known <i>I</i> hadn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re getting too metaphysical for my limited understanding.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense, you understand metaphysics as well as I
do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not disparage yourself. You know I cannot
endure metaphysics.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because they are mostly made in Germany. And all
Germans write as if their aim was to be misunderstood.
Listen to my simple English lay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another love-song to Chloe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, a really great poem, suggested by the number of
papers and poems I have already seen this <i>Moon</i> paragraph

<p class="indent">&quot;That is what will happen with Clorinda Bell&#39;s membership
of our club,&quot; continued the poet. &quot;She will remain
a member long after it has ceased to exist. Once a thing
has appeared in print, you cannot destroy it. A published
lie is immortal. Age cannot wither it, nor custom stale its
infinite variety. It thrives by contradiction. Give me a

The rest of the afternoon Lillie was busy conducting the
Preliminary Examination of a surpassingly beautiful girl
who answered to the name of &quot;Princess,&quot; and would give
no other name for the
present, not even to Turple
the magnificent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You got my letter,
I suppose?&quot; asked the
Princess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said the
President. &quot;I should
have written to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought it best to
come and see you about
it at once, as I have
suddenly determined to
go to Brighton, and I
don&#39;t know when I may
be back. I had not
heard of your Club till
the other day, when I
saw in the <i>Moon</i> that
Clorinda Bell was going
to join it, and anything
she joins must of course
be strictly proper, so I
haven&#39;t troubled to ask
the Honorable Miss
Primpole&#39;s advice&mdash;she
lives with me, you know. An only orphan cannot be too
careful!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You need not fear,&quot; said Lillie. &quot;Miss Bell is not to
be a member. We have refused her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, indeed! Well, perhaps it is as well not to bring
the scent of the footlights over the Club. It is hard upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
Miss Bell, but if you were to admit her, I suppose other
actresses would want to come in. There are so many of
them that prefer to remain single.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure <i>you</i> do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Positive. My experience of lovers has been so harassing
and peculiar that I shall never marry, and as my best
friends cannot call me a wall-flower, I venture to think you
will find me a valuable ally in your noble campaign against
the degrading superstition that Old Maids are women who
have not found husbands, just as widows are women who
have lost them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I sincerely hope so,&quot; said Lillie enthusiastically.
&quot;You express my views very neatly. May I ask what are
the peculiar experiences you speak of?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Some months ago I amused myself by recording
the strange episodes of my first loves, and in anticipation
of your request I have brought the manuscript.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, please read it!&quot; said Lillie excitedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I have not given the real names.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I quite understand. Won&#39;t you have a chocolate
cream before you commence?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. They look lovely. How awfully sweet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too sweet for you?&quot; inquired Lillie anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no. I mean they are just nice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess untied the pretty pink ribbon that enfolded
the dainty, scented manuscript, and pausing only to munch
an occasional chocolate cream, she read on till the shades
of evening fell over the Old Maids&#39; Club and the soft glow
of the candles illuminated its dainty complexion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="center">&quot;THE PRINCESS OF PORTMAN SQUARE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I am an only child. I was born with a silver spoon in
my mouth, and although there was no royal crest on it, yet
no princess could be more comfortable in the purple than
I was in the ordinary trappings of babyhood. From the
cradle upwards I was surrounded with love and luxury.
My pet name &quot;Princess&quot; fitted me like a glove. I was
the autocrat of the nursery and my power scarce diminished
when I rose to the drawing-room. My parents were very
obedient and did not even conceal from me that I was
beautiful. In short they did their best to spoil me, though
I cannot admit that they succeeded. I lost them both
before I was sixteen. My poor mother died first and my
poor father followed within a week; whether from grief or
from a cold caught through standing bareheaded in the
churchyard, or from employing the same doctor, I cannot
precisely determine.</p>

<p class="indent">After the usual period of sorrow, I began to pick up a
bit and to go out under the care of my duenna, a faded
flower of the aristocracy whose declining years my guardian
had soothed by quartering her on me. She was a
gentle old spinster, the seventh daughter of a penniless
peer, and although she has seen hard times and has almost
been reduced to marriage, yet she has scant respect for
my ten thousand a year. She has never lost the sense of
condescension in living with me, and would be horrified
to hear she is in receipt of a salary. It is to this sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
superiority on her part that I owe a good deal of the liberty
I enjoy under her régime. She does not expect in me that
rigid obedience to venerable forms and conventions which
she. prescribes for herself; she regards it as a privilege of
the higher gentlewoman to be bound hand and foot by
fashionable etiquette, and so long as my liberty does not
degenerate into license I am welcome to as much as I please
of it. She has continued to call me &quot;Princess,&quot; finding
doubtless some faint reverberation of pleasure in the magnificent
syllables. I should add that her name is the
Honorable Miss Primpole and that she is not afraid of
the butler.</p>

<p class="indent">Our town-house was situated in Portman Square and my
parents tenanted it during the season. There is nothing
very poetic about the Square, perhaps, not even in the
summer, when the garden is in bloom, yet it was here that
I first learnt to love. This dull parallelogram was the
birthplace of a passion as spiritual and intangible as ever
thrilled maiden&#39;s heart. I fell in love with a Voice.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a rich, baritone Voice, with a compass of two
and a half octaves, rising from full bass organ-notes to
sweet, flute-like tenor tones. It was a glorious Voice, now
resonant with martial ecstasy, now faint with mystic
rapture. Its vibrations were charged with inexpressible
emotion, and it sang of love and death and high heroic
themes. I heard it first a few months after my father&#39;s
funeral. It was night. I had been indoors all day, torpid
and miserable, but roused myself at last and took a few
turns in the square. The air was warm and scented, a
cloudless moon flooded the roadway with mellow light and
sketched in the silhouettes of the trees in the background.
I had reached the opposite side of the square for the
second time when the Voice broke out. My heart stood
still and I with it.</p>

<p class="indent">On the soft summer air the Voice rose and fell; it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
accompanied on the piano, but it seemed in subtler harmony
with the moonlight and the perfumed repose of the
night. It came through an open window behind which
the singer sat in the gloaming. With the first tremors of
that Voice my soul forgot its weariness in a strange sweet
trance that trembled on pain. The song seemed to draw
out all the hidden longing of my maiden soul, as secret
writing is made legible by fire. When the Voice ceased,
a great blackness fell upon all things, the air grew bleak.
I waited and waited but the Square remained silent. The
footsteps of stray pedestrians, the occasional roll of a
carriage alone fell on my anxious ear. I returned to my
house, shivering as with cold. I had never loved before.
I had read and reflected a great deal about love, and was
absolutely ignorant of the subject. I did not know that I
loved now&mdash;for that discover only came later when I
found myself wandering nightly to the other side of the
parallelogram, listening for the Voice. Rarely, very
rarely, was my pilgrimage rewarded, but twice or thrice a
week the Square became an enchanted garden, full of
roses whose petals were music. Round that baritone
Voice I had built up an ideal man&mdash;tall and straight-limbed
and stalwart, fair-haired and blue-eyed and noble-featured,
like the hero of a Northern Saga. His soul was
vast as the sea, shaken with the storms of passion, dimpled
with smiles of tenderness. His spirit was at once
mighty and delicate, throbbing with elemental forces yet
keen and swift to comprehend all subtleties of thought
and feeling. I could not understand myself, yet I felt
that he would understand me. He had the heart of a
lion and of a little child; he was as merciful as he was
strong, as pure as he was wise. To be with him were
happiness, to feel his kiss ecstasy, to be gathered to his
breast, delirium, But alas! he never knew that I was
waiting under his window.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
I made several abortive attempts to discover who he
was or to see him. According to the Directory the house
was occupied by Lady Westerton. I concluded that he
was her elder son. That he might be her husband&mdash;or
some other lady&#39;s&mdash;never even occurred to me. I do not
know why I should have attached the Voice to a bachelor,
any more than I can explain why he should be the eldest
son, rather than the youngest. But romance has a logic
of its own. From the topmost window of my house I
could see Lady Westerton&#39;s house across the trees, but I
never saw him leave or enter it. Once, a week went by
without my hearing him sing. I did not know whether to
think of him as a sick bird or as one flown to warmer
climes. I tried to construct his life from his periods of
song, I watched the lights in his window, my whole life
circled round him. It was only when I grew pale and
feverish and was forced by the doctors and my guardian
to go yachting that my fancies gradually detached themselves
from my blue-eyed hero. The sea-salt freshened
my thoughts, I became a healthy-minded girl again,
carolling joyously in my cabin and taking pleasure in
listening to my own voice. I threw my novels overboard
(metaphorically, that is) and set the Hon. Miss Primpole
chatting instead, when the seascape palled upon me. She
had a great fund of strictly respectable memories. Most
people&#39;s recollections are of no use to anybody but the
owner, but hers afforded entertainment for both of us. By
the time I was back in London the Voice was no longer
part even of my dreams, though it seemed to belong to
them. But for accident it might have remained forever
&quot;a voice and nothing more.&quot; The accident happened at
a musical-afternoon in Kensington. I was introduced
to a tall, fair, handsome blue-eyed guardsman, Captain
Athelstan by name. His conversation was charming and
I took a lot of it, while Miss Primpole was busy flirting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
with a seductive Spaniard. You could not tell Miss
Primpole was flirting except by looking at the man. In
the course of the afternoon the hostess asked the captain
to sing. As he went to the piano my heart began to
flutter with a strange foreboding. He had no music with
him, but plunged at once into the promontory chords.
My agitation increased tenfold. He was playing the
prelude to one of the Voice&#39;s songs&mdash;a strange, haunting
song with a Schubert atmosphere, a song which I had
looked for in vain among the classics. At once he was
transfigured to my eyes, all my sleeping romantic fancies
woke to delicious life, and in the instant in which I waited,
with bated breath, for the outbreak of the Voice at the well-known
turn of the melody, it was borne in upon me that
this was the only man I had ever loved or would ever
love. My Saga hero! my Berserker, my Norse giant!</p>

<p class="indent">When the Voice started it was not <i>my</i> Voice. It was a
thin, throaty tenor. Compared with the Voice of Portman
Square, it was as a tinkling rivulet to a rushing full-volumed
river. I sank back on the lounge, hiding my
emotions behind my fan.</p>

<p class="indent">When the song was finished, he made his way through
the &quot;Bravas&quot; to my side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sweetly pretty!&quot; I murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The song or the singing?&quot; he asked with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The song,&quot; I answered frankly. &quot;Is it yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but the singing is!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His good-humor was so delightful that I forgave his not
having my Voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is its name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is anonymous&mdash;like the composer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must not tell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you give me a copy of the song?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He became embarrassed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
&quot;I would with pleasure, if it were mine. But the fact is&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;had
no right to sing it at all, and the composer
would be awfully vexed if he knew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Original composer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is, indeed. He cannot bear to think of his songs
being sung in public.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me! What a terrible mystery you are making of
it,&quot; I laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O r-really there is no abracadabra about it. You
misunderstand me. But I deserve it all for breaking
faith and exploiting his lovely song so as to drown my
beastly singing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You need not reproach yourself,&quot; I said. &quot;I have
heard it before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He started perceptibly. &quot;Impossible,&quot; he gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; I said freezingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A little bird sang it me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is you who are making the mystery now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tit for tat. But I will discover yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not unless you are a witch!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A witch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am,&quot; I said enigmatically. &quot;So you see it&#39;s of no
use hiding anything from me. Come, tell me all, or I will
belabor you with my broomstick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you know, why should I tell you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to see if you can tell the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I can&#39;t.&quot; We both laughed. &quot;See what a cruel
dilemma you place me in!&quot; he said beseechingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, at least, why he won&#39;t publish his songs. Is
he too modest, too timid?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Neither. He loves art for art&#39;s sake&mdash;that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He writes to please himself. To create music is his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
highest pleasure. He can&#39;t see what it has got to do with
anybody else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But surely he wants the world to enjoy his work?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why? That would be art for the world&#39;s sake, art
for fame&#39;s sake, art for money&#39;s sake!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What an extraordinary view!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why so? The true artist&mdash;the man to whom creation
is rapture&mdash;surely he is his own world. Unless he is
in need of money, why should he concern himself with the
outside universe? My friend cannot understand why
Schopenhauer should have troubled himself to chisel
epigrams or Leopardi lyrics to tell people that life was not
worth living. Had either been a true artist, he would
have gone on living his own worthless life, unruffled by
the applause of the mob. My friend can understand a poet
translating into inspired song the sacred secrets of his soul,
but he cannot understand his scattering them broad-cast
through the country, still less taking a royalty on them.
He says it is selling your soul in the market-place, and
almost as degrading as going on the stage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And do you agree with him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not entirely, otherwise I should never have yielded to
the temptation to sing his song to-night. Fortunately he
will never hear of it. He never goes into society, and I
am his only friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me!&quot; I said sarcastically. &quot;Is he as careful
to conceal his body as his soul?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His face grew grave. &quot;He has an affliction,&quot; he said
in low tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, forgive me!&quot; I said remorsefully. Tears came
into my eyes as the vision of the Norse giant gave away
to that of an English hunchback. My adoring worship
was transformed to an adoring matronly tenderness.
Divinely-gifted sufferer, if I cannot lean on thy strength,
thou shalt lean on mine! So ran my thought till the mist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
cleared from my eyes and I saw again the glorious Saga-hero
at my side, and grew strangely confused and distraught.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is nothing to forgive,&quot; answered Captain Athelstan.
&quot;You did not know him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You forget I am a witch. But I do not know him&mdash;it
is true. I do not even know his name. Yet within a
week I undertake to become a friend of his.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head. &quot;You do not know him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I admitted that,&quot; I answered pertly. &quot;Give me a week,
and he shall not only know me, he shall abjure those sublime
principles of his at my request.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The spirit of mischief moved me to throw down the
challenge. Or was it some deeper impulse?</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled sceptically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course if you know somebody who will introduce
you,&quot; he began.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody shall introduce me,&quot; I interrupted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, he&#39;ll never speak to you first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean it would be unmaidenly for me to speak to
him first. Well, I will bind myself to do nothing of
which Mrs. Grundy would disapprove. And yet the result
shall be as I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall admit you are indeed a witch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t believe in my power, that is. Well, what
will you wager?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you achieve your impossibility, you will deserve
anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you back your incredulity with a pair of gloves?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With a hundred.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. I am not a Briareus. Let us say one
pair then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So be it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But no countermining. Promise me not to communicate
with your mysterious friend in the interval.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
&quot;I promise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how shall I know the result?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I pondered. &quot;I will write&mdash;no, that would be hardly
proper.  Meet me in the Royal Academy, Room Six, at the
&#39;Portrait of a Gentleman,&#39; about noon to-morrow week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A week is a long time!&quot; he sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">I arched my eyebrows. &quot;A week a long time for such
a task!&quot; I exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">Next day I called at the house of the Voice. A gorgeous
creature in plush opened the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to see&mdash;to see&mdash;gracious! I&#39;ve forgotten his
name,&quot; I said in patent chagrin. I clucked my tongue,
puckered my lips, tapped the step with my parasol, then
smiled pitifully at the creature in plush. He turned out
to be only human, for a responsive sympathetic smile
flickered across his pompous face. &quot;You know&mdash;the
singer,&quot; I said, as if with a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh. Lord Arthur!&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; I cried, with a little trill of laughter.
&quot;How stupid of me! Please tell him I want to see him
on an important matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&mdash;he&#39;s very busy, I&#39;m afraid, miss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but he&#39;ll see me,&quot; I said confidently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, miss; who shall I say, miss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Princess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made a startled obeisance, and ushered me into a
little room on the right of the hall.  In a few moments he
returned and said&mdash;&quot;His lordship will be down in a second,
your highness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sixty minutes seemed to go to that second, so racked
was I with curiosity. At last I heard a step outside and
a hand on the door, and at that moment a horrible thought
flashed into my mind. What certainty was there my
singer was a hunchback? Suppose his affliction were
something more loathly. What if he had a monstrous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
wen! For the instant after his entry I was afraid to look
up. When I did, I saw a short, dark-haired young man,
with proper limbs and refined features. But his face wore
a blank expression, and I wondered why I had not divined
before that my musician was blind!</p>

<p class="indent">He bowed and advanced towards me. He came straight
in my direction so that I saw he <i>could</i> see. The blank
expression gave place to one of inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have ventured to call upon your lordship in reference
to a Charity Concert,&quot; I said sweetly; &quot;I am one of
your neighbors, living just across the square, and as the
good work is to be done in this district, I dared to hope that
I could persuade you to take part in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I happened to catch sight of my face in the glass of a
chiffonier as I spoke, and it was as pure and candid and
beautiful as the face of one of Guido&#39;s angels. When I
ceased, I looked up at Lord Arthur&#39;s. It was spasmodically
agitated, the mouth was working wildly. A nervous
dread seized me.</p>

<p class="indent">After what seemed an endless interval, he uttered an
explosive &quot;Put!&quot; following it up by &quot;f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-or two
g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very kind of you,&quot; I interrupted mercifully.
&quot;But I did not propose to ask you for a subscription. I
wanted to enlist your services as a performer. But I fear
I have made a mistake. I understood you sang.&quot; Inwardly
I was furious with the stupid creature in plush for
having misled me into such an unpleasant situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I d-d-d-o s-s-s-s-s&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he answered.</p>

<p class="indent">As he stood there hissing, the truth flashed upon me at
last. I had heard that the most dreadful stammerers enunciate
as easily as anybody else when they sing, because the
measured swing of the time keeps them steady. My heart
sank as I thought of the Voice so mutilated! Poor young
peer! Was this to be the end of all my beautiful visions?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
As cheerfully as I could I cut short his sibilations.
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s all right, then,&quot; I said. &quot;Then I may put
you down for a couple of items.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head, and held up his hands deprecatingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything but that!&quot; he stammered; &quot;Make me a
patron, a committee-man, anything! I do not sing in
public.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">While he was saying this I thought long and deeply.
The affliction was after all less terrible than I had a right
to expect, and I knew from the advertisement columns that
it was easily curable. Demosthenes, I remembered, had
stoned it to death. I felt my love reviving, as I looked
into his troubled face, instinct with the double aristocracy
of rank and genius. At the worst the singing Voice was
unaffected by the disability, and as for the conversational,
well there was consolation in the prospect of having the
last word while one&#39;s husband was still having the first.
<i>En attendant</i>, I could have wished him to sing his replies
instead of speaking them, for not only should I thus enjoy
his Voice but the interchange of ideas would proceed less
tardily. However that would have made him into an operatic
personage, and I did not want him to look so ridiculous
as all that.</p>

<p class="indent">It would be tedious to recount our interview at the
length it extended to. Suffice it to say that I gained my
point. Without letting out that I knew of his theories of
art for art&#39;s sake, I yet artfully pleaded that whatever one&#39;s
views, charity alters cases, inverts everything, justifies
anything. &quot;For instance,&quot; I said with charming <i>naïveté</i>,
&quot;I would not have dared to call on you but in its sacred
name.&quot; He agreed to sing two songs&mdash;nay, two of his
own songs. I was to write to him particulars of time and
place. He saw me to the door. I held out my hand and
he took it, and we looked at each other, smiling brightly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
&quot;B-but I d-d-d-don&#39;t know your n-n-name,&quot; he said suddenly.
&quot;P-p-p-rincess what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke more fluently, now he had regained his composure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Princess,&quot; I answered, my eyes gleaming merrily.
&quot;That is all. The Honorable Miss Primpole will give
me a character, if you require one.&quot; He laughed&mdash;his
laugh was like the Voice&mdash;and followed me with his eyes
as I glided away.</p>

<p class="indent">I had won my gloves&mdash;and in a day. I thought remorsefully
of the poor Saga hero destined to wait a week in suspense
as to the result. But it was too late to remedy this,
and the organization of the Charity Concert needed all my
thoughts. I was in for it now, and I resolved to carry it
through. But it was not so easy as I had lightly assumed.
Getting the artists, of course, was nothing&mdash;there are always
so many professionals out of work or anxious to be brought
out, and so many amateurs in search of amusement. I
could have filled the Albert Hall with entertainers. Nor
did I anticipate any difficulty in disposing of the tickets.
If you are at all popular in society you can get a good deal
of unpopularity by forcing them on your friends. No, the
real difficulty about this Charity Concert was the discovery
of an object in aid of which to give it. In my innocence
I had imagined that the world was simply bustling
with unexploited opportunities for well-doing. Alas!
I soon found that philanthropy was an over-crowded profession.
There was not a single nook or corner of the universe
but had been ransacked by these restless free-lances;
not a gap, not a cranny but had been filled up. In vain I
explored the map, in the hopes of lighting on some undiscovered
hunting-ground in far Cathay or where the khamsin
sweeps the Afric deserts. I found that the wants of the
most benighted savages were carefully attended to, and
that, even when they had none, they were thoughtfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
supplied with them. Anxiously I scanned the newspapers
in search of a calamity, the sufferers by which I might relieve,
but only one happened during that week, and that
was snatched from between my very fingers by a lady who
had just been through the Divorce Court. In my despair
I bethought myself of the preacher I sat under. He was
a very handsome man, and published his sermons by
request.</p>

<p class="indent">I went to him and I said: &quot;How is the church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is all right, thank you,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doesn&#39;t it want anything done to it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it is in perfect repair. My congregation is so very
good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I groaned aloud. &quot;But isn&#39;t there any improvement that
you would like?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The last of the gargoyles was put up last week. Mediæval
architecture is always so picturesque. I have had
the entire structure made mediæval, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But isn&#39;t the outside in need of renovation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! When I have just had it made mediæval!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the interior&mdash;there must be something defective
somewhere!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not to my knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But think! think!&quot; I cried desperately. &quot;The aisles&mdash;transept&mdash;nave&mdash;lectern&mdash;pews&mdash;chancel&mdash;pulpit&mdash;apse&mdash;porch&mdash;altar-cloths&mdash;organ&mdash;spires&mdash;is
there nothing
in need of anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like a colored window to somebody?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the windows are taken up. My congregation is so
very good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A memorial brass then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He mused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is only one of my flock who has done anything
memorable lately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
My heart gave a great leap of joy. &quot;Then why do you
neglect him?&quot; I asked indignantly. &quot;If we do not perpetuate
the memory of virtue&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s alive,&quot; he interrupted.</p>

<p class="indent">I bit my lips in vexation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you need a few more choristers,&quot; I murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh no, we are sending some away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Sunday School Fund&mdash;how is that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am looking about for a good investment for the surplus.
Do you know of any? A good mortgage, perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there none on the church?&quot; I cried with a flicker
of hope.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heaven forbid!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I cudgelled my brains frantically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of a lightning-rod!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A premier necessity. I never preach in a building
unprotected by one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I made one last wild search.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How about a reredos?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at me in awful, pained silence.</p>

<p class="indent">I saw I had stumbled. &quot;I&mdash;I mean a new wing,&quot; I
stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid you are not well this morning,&quot; said the
preacher, patting my hand soothingly. &quot;Won&#39;t you come
and talk it over, whatever it is, another time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no,&quot; I cried excitedly. &quot;It must be settled at
once. I have it. A new peal of bells!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter with the bells?&quot; he asked anxiously.
&quot;There isn&#39;t a single one cracked.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I saw his dubiety, and profited by it. I learnt afterwards
it was due to his having no ear of his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cracked! Perhaps not,&quot; I replied in contemptuous
accents. &quot;But they deserve to be. No wonder the newspapers
keep correspondences going on the subject.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
&quot;Yes, but what correspondents object to is the bells
ringing at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t wonder,&quot; I said. &quot;I don&#39;t say your bells are
worse than the majority, or that I haven&#39;t got a specially
sensitive ear for music, but I know that when I hear
their harsh clanging, I&mdash;well I don&#39;t feel inclined to go
to church and that&#39;s the truth. I am quite sure if you
had a really musical set of chimes, it would increase the
spirituality of the neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How so?&quot; he asked sceptically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would keep down swearing on Sunday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; He pondered a moment, then said: &quot;But that
would be a great expense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed? I thought bells were cheap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Area bells, hand-bells, sleigh-bells. But
Church-bells are very costly. There are only a few foundries
in the kingdom. But why are you so concerned
about my church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I am giving a Charity Concert, and I should
like to devote the proceeds to something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A very exemplary desire. But I fear one bell is the
most you could get out of a Charity Concert.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I looked disappointed. &quot;What a pity! It would have
been such a nice precedent to improve the tone of the
Church. The &#39;constant readers&#39; would have had to cease
their letters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, impossible. A &#39;constant reader&#39; seems to be
so called because he is a constant writer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there might have been leaders about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hardly sensational enough for that! Stay I have an
idea. In the beautiful Ages of Faith, when a Church-bell
was being cast, the pious used to bring silver vessels
to be fused with the bell-metal in the furnace, so as to
give the bell a finer tone. A mediæval practice is always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
so poetical. Perhaps I could revive it. My congregation
is so very good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good!&quot; I echoed, clapping my hands.
&quot;But a Concert will not suffice&mdash;we shall need a Bazaar,&quot;
said the preacher.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but I must have a Concert!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly Bazaars include
Concerts.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 329px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>How the Duchess wanted
to appear.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">That was how the Great
Church Bazaar originated
and how the Rev. Melitos
Smith came to resurrect
the beautiful mediæval
custom which brought him
so much kudos and extracted
such touching sentiments
from hardened
journalists. The Bazaar
lasted a week, and raised a
number of ladies in the
social scale, and married
off three of my girl-friends,
and cut me off the visiting
list of the Duchess of
Dash. She was pining for
a chance of coming out in
a comic opera chanson,
but this being a Church
Bazaar I couldn&#39;t allow her
to kick up her heels. Everything
could be bought at that Bazaar, from photographs
of the Rev. Melitos Smith to impracticable mouse-traps,
from bread-and-cheese to kisses. There were endless
side-shows, and six gipsy girls scattered about the rooms,
so that you could have your fortune told in six different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
ways. I should not like to say how much that Bazaar cost
me when the bill for the Bells came in, but then Lord Arthur
sang daily in the Concert Hall, and I could also deduct
the price of the pair of gloves Captain Athelstan gave me.
For the Captain honorably stood the loss of his wager, nay,
more, cheerfully accepted his defeat, and there on the spot&mdash;before
the &quot;Portrait of another Gentleman&quot;&mdash;offered
to enlist in the Bazaar. And very useful he proved, too.
We had to be together, organizing it, nearly all day and
I don&#39;t know what I should have done without him. I
don&#39;t know what his Regiment did without him, but then
I have never been able to find out when our gallant officers
do their work. They seem always to be saving it up for
a rainy day.</p>

<p class="indent">I was never more surprised in my life than when, on
the last night of the Bazaar-boom, amid the buzz of a
brisk wind-up, Lord Arthur and Captain Athelstan came
into the little presidential sanctum, which had been run
up for me, and requested a special interview.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can give you five minutes,&quot; I said, for I felt my
finger was on the pulse of the Bazaar, and my time correspondingly
important.</p>

<p class="indent">They looked grateful, then embarrassed. Captain
Athelstan opened his mouth and closed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>You</i> had better tell her,&quot; he said, nervously, to Lord
Arthur.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;N-n-no, y-y-y-y&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, Captain Athelstan?&quot; I interrupted, pointedly,
for I had only five minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Princess, we both love you,&quot; began the Captain, blushing
like a hobbledehoy, and rushing <i>in medias res</i>. I
allowed them to call me Princess, because it was not my
Christian name.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this the time&mdash;when I am busy feeling the pulse of
the Bazaar?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
&quot;You gave us five minutes,&quot; pleaded the Captain, determined
to do or die, now he was in the thick of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on,&quot; I said, &quot;I will forgive you everything&mdash;even
your love of me&mdash;if you are only brief.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We both love you. We are great friends. We have
no secrets. We told each other. We are doubtful if you
love either&mdash;or which. We have come together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He fired off the short, sharp sentences as from a six-barrelled
revolver.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Captain Athelstan&mdash;Lord Arthur,&quot; I said. &quot;I am
deeply touched by the honor you have done your friendship
and me. I will be equally frank&mdash;and brief&mdash;with
you. I cannot choose either of you, because I love you
both. Like every girl, I formed an ideal of a lover. I
have been fortunate in finding my ideal in the flesh. I
have been unfortunate in finding it in two pieces. Fate
has bisected it, and given the form to one and the voice
to the other. My ideal looks like you, Captain Athelstan,
and sings like you, Lord Arthur. It is a stupid position,
I know, and I feel like the donkey between two bundles
of hay. But under the circumstances I have no choice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They looked at each other half-rapturously, half-despairingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what&#39;s to be done?&quot; cried the Captain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I said, hopelessly. &quot;Love seems not
only blind, but a blind alley, this time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;D-do you m-m-ean,&quot; asked Lord Arthur, &quot;&#39;how happy
could I be with either, were t&#39;other dear charmer away?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I was glad he sang it, because it precipitated matters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the precise position,&quot; I admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, then, Arthur, my boy, I congratulate you,&quot; said
the Captain, huskily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;N-n-no, I&#39;ll g-g-go away,&quot; said the singer.</p>

<p class="indent">They wrangled for full ten minutes, but the position
remained a block.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Bazaar proposal of Marriage.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; I interposed, &quot;if either of you had consented
to accept the other&#39;s sacrifice, the problem would
have been solved; only I should have taken the other.
But two self-sacrifices are as bad as none.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then let us toss up for you, Princess,&quot; said the Captain,
impulsively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no!&quot; I cried, with a shudder. &quot;Submit my life
to the chances of head or tail! It would make me
feel like a murderess, with you for gentlemen of the
jury.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A painful silence fell upon the sanctum. Unwitting of
the tragedy playing within, all the fun of the fair went on
without.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen,&quot; I said, at last. &quot;I will be the wife of him
who wins me. Chance shall not decide, but prowess.
Like the princesses of old, I will set you a task. Whoever
accomplishes it shall win my hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Agreed,&quot; they said eagerly, though not simultaneously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, but what shall it be?&quot; I murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not a competition?&quot; suggested the Captain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, a competition&mdash;provided you promise to
fight fair, and not play into each other&#39;s hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They promised, and together we excogitated and rejected
all sorts of competitions. The difficulty was to
find something in which each would have a fair chance.
At length we arranged that they should play a game of
chess, the winner to be mated. They agreed it would be
a real &quot;match game.&quot; The five minutes had by this time
lasted half an hour, so I dismissed them, and hastened to
feel the pulse of the Bazaar, which was getting more and
more feverish as the break-up drew nigh.</p>

<p class="indent">They played the game in Lord Arthur&#39;s study. Lord
Arthur was white and the Captain black. Everything was
fair and above board. But they played rather slowly.
Every evening I sent the butler over to make inquiries.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
&quot;The Princess&#39;s compliments,&quot; he was told to say,
&quot;and how is it to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is getting on,&quot; they told him, and he came back
with a glad face. He was a kind soul despite his calves,
and he thought there was a child dying.</p>

<p class="indent">Once a week I used to go over and look at it. Ostensibly
I called in connection with the Bazaar accounts. I
could not see any difference in the position from one
week&#39;s end to another. There seemed to be a clump of
pawns in the middle, with all the other pieces looking idly
on; there was no thoroughfare anywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">They told me it always came like that when you played
cautiously. They said it was a French opening. I could
not see any opening anywhere; it certainly was not the
English way of fighting. Picture my suspense during those
horrible weeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this the way all match-games are played?&quot; I said
once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;N-n-o,&quot; admitted Lord Arthur. &quot;We for-g-g-ot to
p-p-p-ut a t-t-t-t-t-time-limit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the time-limit?&quot; I asked the Captain, wishing
my singer could learn to put one to his sentences.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So many moves must be made in an hour&mdash;usually
fifteen. Otherwise the younger champion would always
win, merely by outliving the elder. We forgot to include
that condition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At length our butler brought back word that &quot;it couldn&#39;t
last much longer.&quot; His face was grave and he gave the
message in low tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a blessing. It&#39;s been lingering long enough!
I wish they would polish it off,&quot; I murmured fretfully.
After that I frequently caught him looking at me as if I
were Lucrezia Borgia.</p>

<p class="indent">The end came suddenly. The butler went across to make
the usual inquiry. He returned, with a foolish face of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
horror and whispered, &quot;It is all over. It has been drawn
by perpetual check!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great Heavens!&quot; I cried. My consternation was
so manifest that he forgave the utterance of a peevish
moment. I put on my nicest hat at once and went over.
We held a council of war afresh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s go by who catches the biggest trout,&quot; suggested
the Captain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;I will not be angled for. Besides, the
biggest is not grammatical. It should be the bigger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus reproved, the Captain grew silent and we came
to a deadlock once more. I gave up the hunt at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think the best plan will be for you both to go away
and travel. Go round the world, see fresh faces, try to forget
me. One of you will succeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But suppose we both succeed?&quot; asked the Captain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That would be more awkward than ever,&quot; I admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And if neither succeed?&quot; asked Lord Arthur at some
length.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should say neither succeeds,&quot; I remarked severely.
&quot;Neither takes a singular verb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; said Lord Arthur with some spirit. &quot;The
plurality is merely apparent. &#39;Succeed&#39; is subjunctive
after if.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, true,&quot; I said. &quot;Then suppose you go round the
world and I give my hand to whoever comes back and
proposes to me first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something like the man in Jules Verne!&quot; cried the
Captain. &quot;Glorious!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Except that it can be done quicker now,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Arthur fell in joyously with the idea, which was a
godsend to me, for the worry of having about you two
men whom you love and who love you cannot be easily
conceived by those who have not been through it. They,
too, were pining away and felt the journey would do them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
good. Captain Athelstan applied for three months&#39; furlough.
He was to put a girdle round the earth from West
to East, Lord Arthur from East to West. It was thought
this would work fairly&mdash;as whatever advantages one outgoing
route had over the other would be lost on the return.
Each drew up his scheme and prepared his equipment.
The starting-point was to be my house, and consequently
this was also the goal. After forty-eight days had passed
(the minimum time possible) I was to remain at home day
and night, awaiting the telegram which was to be sent the
moment either touched English soil again. On the receipt
of the telegram I was to take up my position at the front
window on the ground floor, with a white rose in my hair
to show I was still unwon, and to wait there day and night
for the arrival of my offer of marriage, which I was not
to have the option of refusing. During the race they were
not to write to me.</p>

<p class="indent">The long-looked-for day of their departure duly arrived.
Two hansoms were drawn up side by side, in front of the
house. A white rose in my hair, I sat at the window. A
parting smile, a wave of my handkerchief, and my lovers
were off. In an instant they were out of sight. For a
month they were out of mind, too. After the exhausting
emotions I had undergone this period of my life was truly
halcyon. I banished my lovers from my memory and enjoyed
what was left of the season and of my girlish freedom.
In two months I should be an affianced wife and
it behoved me to make the best of my short span of spinsterhood.
The season waned, fashion drifted to Cowes,
I was left alone in empty London. Then my thoughts
went back to the two travellers. As day followed day,
my anxiety and curiosity mounted proportionately. The
forty-eight days went by, but there was no wire. They
passed slowly&mdash;oh, so slowly&mdash;into fifty, while I waited,
waited, from dawn to midnight, with ears pricked up, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
that double rat-tat which came not or which came about
something else. The sands of September dribbled out,
and my fate still hung in the balance. I went about the
house like an unquiet spirit. In imagination I was seeing
those two men sweeping towards me&mdash;one from the East
of the world, one from the West. And there I stood, rooted
to the spot, while from either side a man was speeding inevitably
towards me, across oceans and continents, through
canals and tunnels, along deserts or rivers, pressing into
his service every human and animal force and every blind
energy that man had tamed. To my fevered imagination
I seemed to be between the jaws of a leviathan, which
were closing upon me at a terrific rate, yet which took days
to snap together, so wide were they apart, so gigantic was
the monster. Which of the jaws would touch me first?</p>

<p class="indent">The fifties mounted into the sixties, but there was no
telegram. The tension became intolerable. Again and
again I felt tempted to fly, but a lingering sense of honor
kept me to my post. On the sixty-first day my patience
was rewarded. Sitting at my window one morning I
saw a telegraph-boy sauntering along. He reached the
gate. He paused. I rushed to the door and down the steps,
seized the envelope and tore it frantically open.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;<i>Coming, but suppose all over.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arthur.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I leaned on the gate, half fainting. When I went to my
room, I read the wire again and noted it had been handed
in at Liverpool. In four or five hours at most I should
cease to belong to myself. I communicated the news to the
Honorable Miss Primpole who congratulated me cordially.
She made no secret of her joy that the nobleman had
won. For my part I was still torn with conflicting emotions.
Now that I knew it was to be the one, I hankered after
the other. Yet in the heart of the storm there was peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
in the thought that the long suspense was over. I
ordered a magnificent repast to be laid for the home-coming
voyager, which would also serve to celebrate our
nuptials. The Honorable Miss Primpole consented to
grace the board and the butler to surrender the choicest
vintages garnered in my father&#39;s cellar.</p>

<p class="indent">Two hours and a half dragged by; then there came
another wire&mdash;I opened it with some curiosity, but as my
eye caught the words I almost swooned with excitement.
It ran:</p>

<p class="center">&quot;<i>Arrived, but presume too late.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Athelstan.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With misty vision I strove to read the place of despatch.
It was Dover. A great wave of hope surged in my bosom.
My Saga-hero might yet arrive in time. Half frenziedly I
turned over the leaves of Bradshaw. No, after sending
that wire, he would just have missed the train to Victoria!
Cruel! Cruel! But stay! there was another
route. He might have booked for Charing Cross. Yes!
Heaven be praised, if he did that, he would just catch a
train. And of course he would do that&mdash;surely he would
have planned out every possibility while crossing the
Channel, have arranged for all&mdash;my Captain, my blue-eyed
Berserker! But then Lord Arthur had had two and a
half hours&#39; start.&mdash;I turned to Liverpool and essayed to
discover whether that was sufficient to balance the difference
of the two distances from London. Alas! my head
swam before I had travelled two stations. There were
no less than four routes to Euston, to St. Pancras, to
King&#39;s Cross, to Paddington! Still I made out that if
he had kept his head very clear, and been very, very fortunate,
he might just get level with the Captain. But
then on a longer route the chances of accidental delays
were more numerous. On the whole the odds were
decidedly in favor of the Captain. But one thing was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
certain&mdash;that they would both arrive in time for supper.
I ordered an additional cover to be laid, then I threw myself
upon a couch and tried to read. But I could not.
Terrible as was the strain, my thoughts refused to be distracted.
The minutes crawled along&mdash;gradually peace
came back as I concluded that only by a miracle could
Lord Arthur win. At last I jumped up with a start, for
the shades of evening were falling and my toilette was
yet to make. I dressed myself in a dainty robe of white,
trimmed with sprays of wild flowers, and I stuck the white
rose in my hair&mdash;the symbol that I was yet unasked in
wedlock, the white star of hope to the way-worn wanderer!
I did my best to be the fairest sight the travellers should
have seen in all the world.</p>

<p class="indent">The Honorable Miss Primpole started when she saw
me. &quot;What have you been doing to yourself, Princess?&quot;
she said. &quot;You&#39;re lovelier than I ever dreamed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And indeed the crisis had lent a flush to my cheek and
a flash to my eye which I would not willingly repay.
My bosom rose and fell with excitement. In half an hour
I should be in my Saga-hero&#39;s arms! I went down to the
ground-floor front and seated myself at the open window
and gazed at the Square and the fiery streaks of sunset in
the sky. The Honorable Miss Primpole lay upon an ottoman,
less excited. Every now and again she asked,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you see anything, Princess?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course she did not take my answer literally. Several
times cabs and carriages rattled past the window,
but with no visible intention of drawing up. Duskier,
duskier grew the September evening, as I sat peering into
the twilight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you see anything, Princess?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A moment after a hansom came dashing into sight&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
head protruded from it. I uttered a cry and leant forward,
straining my eyes. Captain Athelstan. Yes! No! No!
Yes! No! <i>No!</i> Will it be believed that (such is the
heart of woman) I felt a sensation of relief on finding the
issue still postponed? For in the moment when the Captain
seemed to flash upon my vision&mdash;it was borne in
upon me like a chilling blast that I had lost my Voice.
Never would that glorious music swell for me as I sat
alone with my husband in the gloaming.</p>

<p class="indent">The streaks of sunset faded into gray ashes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you see anything, Princess?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even as I spoke I heard the gallop of hoofs in the
quiet Square, and, half paralyzed by the unexpected vision,
I saw Lord Arthur dashing furiously up on horseback&mdash;Lord
Arthur, bronzed and bearded and travel-stained, but
Lord Arthur beyond a doubt. He took off his hat and
waved it frantically in the air when he caught sight of my
white figure, with the white rose of promise nestling in my
hair. My poor Saga-hero!</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>At the winning Post.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">He reined in his beautiful steed before my window and
commenced his proposal breathlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>W-w-w</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even Mr. Gladstone, if he had been racing as madly
as Lord Arthur might well have been flustered in his
speech. The poor singer could not get out the first word,
try as he would. At last it came out like a soda-water
cork and &#39;<i>you</i>&#39; with it. But at the &#39;<i>be</i>&#39; there was&mdash;O
dire to tell!&mdash;another stoppage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>B-b-b-b-b</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fire! Fire! Hooray!&quot; The dull roar of an advancing
crowd burst suddenly upon our ears, mingled with the
piercing exultation of small boys. The thunderous clatter
of the fire-engine seemed to rock the soil of the Square.</p>

<p class="indent">But neither of us took eyes off the other.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
&quot;<i>Be!</i>&quot; It was out at last. The end was near. In
another second I should say &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fire! Fire!&quot; shrieked the small boys.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>M-m-m-y</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Arthur&#39;s gallant steed shifted uneasily. The fire-engine
was thundering down upon it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>W-w-w</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Will you be</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot; The clarion notes of the Captain
rang out above the clatter of the fire-engine from which he
madly jumped.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<i>Wife?</i>&quot; }<br />
&quot;<i>Mine?</i>&quot; } the two travellers exclaimed together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dead heat,&quot; I murmured, and fell back in a dead faint.
My overwrought nerves could stand no more.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Nevertheless it was a gay supper-party; the air was
thick with travellers&#39; tales, and the butler did not spare the
champagne. We could not help being tickled by the
quaint termination of the colossal globe-trotting competition,
and we soothed Lord Arthur&#39;s susceptibilities by insisting
that if he had only remembered the shorter proposal
formula employed by his rival, he would have won
by a word. It was a pure fluke that the Captain was able
to tie, for he had not thought of telegraphing for a horse,
but had taken a hansom at the station, and only exchanged
to the fire-engine when he heard people shouting there was
a fire in Seymour Street. Lord Arthur obliged five times
during the evening, and the Honorable Miss Primpole relaxed
more than ever before and accompanied him on the
banjo. Before we parted, I had been persuaded by my
lovers to give them one last trial. That night three months
I was to give another magnificent repast, to which they
were both to be invited. During the interval each was to
do his best to become famous, and at the supper-party I
was to choose the one who was the more widely known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom. They
were to place before me what proofs and arguments they
pleased, and I was to decide whose name had penetrated
to the greater number of people. There was to be no
appeal from my decision, nor any limitation to what the
candidates might do to force themselves upon the universal
consciousness, so
long as they did
not merely advertise
themselves at so
much a column or
poster. They could
safely be trusted
not to do anything
infamous in the attempt
to become famous,
and so there
was no need to impose
conditions. I
had a secret hope
that Lord Arthur
might thus be induced
to bring his
talents before the
world and get over
his objection to the
degradation of public
appearances. My
hope was more than
justified.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 439px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;<i>Ba, ba, ba, boodle-dee.</i>&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">I grieve to say neither strove to benefit his kind. His
lordship went on the music-hall stage, made up as a costermonger,
and devoted his wonderful voice and his musical
genius to singing a cockney ballad with a chorus consisting
merely of the words &quot;Ba, ba, ba, boodle-dee&quot; repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
sixteen times. It caught on like a first-class epidemic.
&quot;Ba, ba, ba, boodle-dee&quot; microbes floated in
every breeze. The cholera-chorus raged from Piccadilly
to Land&#39;s End, from Kensington to John o&#39;Groats. The
swarthy miners hewed the coal to it. It dropped from
passing balloons, the sailors manned the capstan to it, and
the sound of it superseded fog-horns. Duchesses danced
to it, and squalid infants cried for it. Divines with difficulty
kept it out of their sermons, philosophers drew
weighty lessons from it, critics traced its history, and as
it didn&#39;t mean anything the greatest Puritans hummed it
inaccurately. &quot;Ba, ba, ba, boodle-dee,&quot; sang Lord Arthur
nightly at six halls and three theatres, incidentally clearing
off all the debts on the family estates, and, like a flock
of sheep, the great British public took up the bleat, and in
every hall and drawing-room blossomed the big pearl
buttons of the cockney costermonger.</p>

<p class="indent">But Captain Athelstan came to the front far more easily,
if less profitably. He sent a testimonial to the Perfect
Cure Elixir. The Elixir was accustomed to testimonials
from the suffering millions. The spelling generally had to
be corrected before they were fit for publication. It also
received testimonials which were useless, such as: &quot;I
took only one bottle of your Elixir and I got fourteen
days.&quot; But a testimonial from a Captain of the Guards
was a gold-mine. The Captain&#39;s was the best name the
Elixir had ever had, and he had enjoyed more diseases than
it had hitherto professed to cure. Astonished by its own
success the Elixir resolved to make a big spurt and kill off
all its rivals. For the next few months Captain Athelstan
was rammed down the throats of all England. He came
with the morning milk in all the daily papers, he arrived by
the first post in a circular, he stared at people from every
dead wall when they went out to business, he was with
them at lunch, in little plaques and placards in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
restaurant, he nodded at them in every bar, rode with
them in every train and tram-car, either on the wall or on
the back of the ticket, joined them at dinner in the evening
papers and supplied the pipe lights after the meal.
You took up a magazine and found he had slipped
between the sheets, you went to bed and his diseased
figure haunted your dreams. Life lost its sweetness, literature
its charm. The loathsome phantasm of the complexly-afflicted
Captain got between you and the sunshine.
Stiff examination papers (compiled from the Captain)
were set at every breakfast-table, and you were sternly
interrogated as to whether you felt an all-gone sensation
at the tip of your nose, and you were earnestly adjured to
look at your old diseases. You began to read an eloquent
description of the Alps, and lo! there was the Captain
perched on top. You started a thrilling story of the sea,
and the Captain bobbed up from the bottom; you began
a poetical allegory concerning the Valley of the Shadow,
and you found the Captain had been living there all his
life&mdash;till he came upon the Elixir. A little innocent
child remarked, &quot;Pater, it is almost bath-time,&quot; and you
felt for your handkerchief in view of a touching domestic
idyl, but the Captain froze your tears. &quot;Why have sunstroke
in India?&quot; you were asked, and the Captain supplied
the answer. Something came like a thief in the
night. It was the Captain. You were startled to see
that there was &quot;A Blight Over All Creation,&quot; but it
turned out to be only the Captain. Everything abutted
on the Captain&mdash;Shakespeare and the musical glasses,
the Venus of Milo and the Mikado, Day and Night and
all the seasons, the potato harvest and the Durham Coal
Strike, the advantages of early rising, and the American
Copyright Act. He was at the bottom of every passage,
he lurked in every avenue, he was at the end of every
perspective.  The whole world was familiar with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
physical symptoms, and his sad history. The exploits of
Julius Cæsar were but a blur in the common mind, but
everybody knew that the Captain&#39;s skin grew Gobelin blue,
that the whites of his eyes turned green, and his tongue
stuck in his cheek, and that the rest of his organism
behaved with corresponding gruesomeness. Everybody
knew how they dropped off, &quot;petrified by my breath,&quot; and
how his sympathetic friends told him in large capitals</p>

<p class="center">&quot;<span class="smcap">You will never get better, Captain</span>,&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">and how his weeping mother, anxious to soothe his last
hours, remarked in reply to a request for another box of
somebody else&#39;s pills,</p>

<p class="center">&quot;<span class="smcap">The only box you&#39;ll ever want will be a Coffin</span>,&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">and how</p>

<p class="center">&quot;<span class="smcap">He thought it was only Cholera</span>,&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">but how one dose of the Elixir (which new-born babies
clamored for in preference to their mother&#39;s milk) had
baffled all their prognostications and made him a celebrity
for life. In private the Captain said that he really had
these ailments, though he only discovered the fact when
he read the advertisements of the Elixir. But the Mess
had an inkling that it was all done for a wager, and christened
him &quot;The Perfect Cure.&quot; To me he justified himself
on the ground that he had scrupulously described
himself as having his tongue in his cheek, and that he
really suffered from love-sickness, which was worse than
all the ills the Elixir cured.</p>

<p class="indent">I need scarcely say that I was shocked by my lovers&#39;
practical methods of acquiring that renown for which so
many gifted souls have yearned in vain, though I must
admit that both gentlemen retained sufficient sense of
decorum to be revolted by the other&#39;s course of action.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
They remonstrated with each other gently but firmly.
The result was that their friendship snapped and a week
before the close of the competition they crossed the Channel
to fight a duel. I got to hear of it in time and wired
to Boulogne that if they killed each other I would marry
neither, that if only one survived I would never marry my
lover&#39;s murderer, and that a duel excited so much gossip
that, if both survived, they would be equally famous and
the competition again a failure.</p>

<p class="indent">These simple considerations prevented any mishap.
The Captain returned to his Regiment and Lord Arthur
went on to the Riviera to while away the few remaining
days and to get extra advertisement out of not appearing
at his halls through indisposition. At Monte Carlo he
accidentally broke the bank, and explained his system to
the interviewers. To my chagrin, for I was tired of see-sawing,
this brought him level with the Captain again. I
had been prepared to adjudicate in favour of the latter,
on the ground that although &quot;Ba, ba, ba, boodle-dee&quot;
was better known than the Patent Cure Elixir, yet the
originator of the song remained unknown to many to
whom the Captain was a household word, and this in
despite of the extra attention secured to Lord Arthur by
his rank. The second supper-party was again sicklied
over with the pale cast of thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No more competitions!&quot; I said. &quot;You seem destined
to tie with each other instead of with me. I will return
to my original idea. I will give you a task which it is not
likely both will perform. I will marry the man who asks
me, provided he comes, neither walking nor riding, neither
sailing nor driving, neither skating nor sliding nor flying,
neither by boat nor by balloon nor by bicycle, neither by
swimming nor by floating nor by anybody carrying or dragging
or pushing him, neither by any movement of hand
or foot nor by any extraordinary method whatever.  Till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
this is achieved neither of you must look upon my face
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They looked aghast when I set the task. They went
away and I have not seen them from that day to this. I
shall never marry now. So I may as well devote myself
to the cause of the Old Maids you are so nobly championing.&quot;
She rolled up the MS.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; said Lillie excitedly, breaking in for the first
time, &quot;what is the way you want them to come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess laughed a silvery laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No way. Don&#39;t you understand? It was a roundabout
way of saying I was tired of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, I got the idea from a fairy-tale,&quot; said the
Princess. &quot;There, the doer evaded the conditions by being
dragged at a horse&#39;s tail&mdash;I have guarded against this,
so that now the thing is impossible.&quot; Again her mischievous
laughter rang out through the misanthropic room.</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie smiled, too. She felt certain Lord Silverdale would
find no flaw in the Princess&#39;s armor, and she was exultant
at so auspicious an accession. For the sake of formality,
however, she told her that she would communicate her
election by letter.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day a telegram came to the Club.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Compelled to withdraw candidature. Feat accomplished.</i>
<span class="smcap">Princess, Hotel Metropole, Brighton.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Equally aghast and excited, Lillie wired back, &quot;<i>How?</i>&quot;
and prepaid the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Lover happened to be here. Came up in lift as I was
waiting to go down.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still intensely piqued by curiosity and vexation, Lillie
telegraphed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Which?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Leave you to guess</i>,&quot; answered the electric current.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="center">THE GRAMMAR OF LOVE.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Moon</i>-man&#39;s name was Wilkins, and he did nine-tenths
of the interviews in that model of the new journalism.
Wilkins was the man to catch the weasel asleep, hit
off his features with a kodak, and badger him the moment
he awoke as to why he popped. Wilkins lived in a flat
in Chancery Lane, and had his whiskey and his feet on the
table when Silverdale turned the handle of the door in the
gloaming.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want?&quot; said Wilkins gruffly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have come to ask you a few questions,&quot; said Silverdale
politely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I don&#39;t know you, sir,&quot; said Wilkins stiffly.
&quot;Don&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is true I am a stranger, but remember, sir, I shall
not be so when I leave. I just want to interview you
about that paragraph in the <i>Moon</i>, stating&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here!&quot; roared Wilkins, letting his feet slide from
the table with a crash. &quot;Let me tell you, sir, I have no
time to listen to your impertinence. My leisure is scant
and valuable. I am a hard-worked man. I can&#39;t be pestered
with questions from inquisitive busybodies. What
next, sir? What I write in the <i>Moon</i> is my business and
nobody else&#39;s. Damn it all, sir, is there to be nothing
private? Are you going to poke and pry into the concerns
of the very journalist? No, sir, you have wasted your
time as well as mine. We never allow the public to go
behind what appears in our paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
&quot;But this is a mere private curiosity&mdash;what you tell me
shall never be published.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it could be, I wouldn&#39;t tell it you. I never waste
copy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me&mdash;I am willing to pay for the information&mdash;who
wrote the paragraph about Clorinda Bell and the Old
Maids&#39; Club.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go to the devil!&quot; roared Wilkins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you would know more than he,&quot; said Silverdale,
and left. Wilkins came downstairs on his heels,
in a huff, and walked towards Ludgate Hill. Silverdale
thought he would have another shot, and followed him unseen.
The two men jumped into a train, and after an endless-seeming
journey arrived at the Crystal Palace. A
monster balloon was going off from the grounds. Herr
Nickeldorf, the great aeronaut, was making in solitude an
experimental night excursion to Calais, as if anxious to
meet his fate by moonlight alone. Wilkins rushed up to
Nickeldorf, who was standing among the ropes giving
directions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go avay!&quot; said Nickeldorf, when he saw him. &quot;I hafe
nodings to say to you. You makes me <i>schwitzen</i>.&quot; He
jumped into the car and bade the men let go.</p>

<p class="indent">Ordinarily Wilkins would have been satisfied with this
ample material for half a column, but he was still in a bad
temper, and, as the car was sailing slowly upwards, he
jumped in, and the aeronaut gave himself up for pumped.
In an instant, moved by an irresistible impulse, Silverdale
gave a great leap and stood by the <i>Moon</i>-man&#39;s side. The
balloon shot up and the roar of the crowd became a faint
murmur as the planet flew from beneath their feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-evening, Mr. Wilkins,&quot; said Lord Silverdale. &quot;I
should just like to interview you about&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You jackanapes!&quot; cried the <i>Moon</i>-man, pale with anger,
&quot;If you don&#39;t go away at once, I&#39;ll kick you down stairs.&quot;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
&quot;My dear Mr. Wilkins,&quot; suavely replied Lord Silverdale,
&quot;I will willingly go down, provided you accompany
me. I am sure Herr Nickeldorf is anxious to drop both
of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Wirklich</i>,&quot; replied the aeronaut</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, lend us a parachute,&quot; said Silverdale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, danks. Beobles never return barachutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we won&#39;t go without one. I forgot to bring
mine with me. I didn&#39;t know I was going to have such a
high old time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By what right, sir,&quot; said Mr. Wilkins, who had been
struggling with an attack of speechlessness, &quot;do you persecute
me like this? <i>You</i> are not a member of the Fourth
Estate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I belong merely to the Second.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh? What? A Peer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am Lord Silverdale.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed! Lord Silverdale!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord Silverdale!&quot; echoed the aeronaut, letting two
sand-bags fall into the clouds. Most people lose their
ballast in the presence of the aristocracy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I am so glad! I have long been anxious to meet
your lordship,&quot; said the <i>Moon</i>-man, taking out his notebook.
&quot;What is your lordship&#39;s opinion of the best fifty
books for the working man&#39;s library?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not yet written fifty books.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said the <i>Moon</i>-man, carefully noting down the
reply. &quot;And when is your lordship&#39;s next book coming
out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the <i>Moon</i>-man, writing it down.
&quot;Will it be poetry or prose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is as the critics shall decide.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it true that your lordship has been converted to
Catholicism?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
&quot;I believe not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then how does your lordship account for the rumor?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have an indirect connection with a sort of new
nunnery, which it is proposed to found&mdash;the Old Maids&#39;
Club.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, the one that Clorinda Bell is going to join.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense! who told you she was going to join?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Moon</i>-man winced perceptibly at the question, as
he replied indignantly: &quot;Herself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. That&#39;s what I wanted to know. You
may contradict it on the authority of the president. She
only said so to get an advertisement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why give her two by contradicting it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the woman&#39;s cleverness. Let her have the
advertisement, rather than that her name should be connected
with Miss Dulcimer&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. Tell me something, please, about the
Club.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not organized yet. It is to consist of young and
beautiful women, vowed to celibacy to remove the reproach
of the term &#39;Old Maid.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a noble idea!&quot; said the <i>Moon</i>-man, enthusiastically.
&quot;Oh, what a humanitarian time we are having!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord Silverdale,&quot; said Herr Nickeldorf, who had
been listening with all his ears, &quot;I hafe to you give de
hospitality of my balloon. Vill you, in return, take <i>mein
frau</i> into de Old Maids&#39; Club?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As a visitor? With pleasure, as she is a married
woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Nein, nein.</i> I mean as an old maid. <i>Ich habe sic
nicht nöthig.</i> I do not require her any longer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, then, I am afraid we can&#39;t. You see she <i>isn&#39;t</i> an
old maid!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she haf been.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes, but we do not recognize past services.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
&quot;Oh, <i>warum</i> wasn&#39;t the Club founded before I married?&quot;
groaned the old German. &quot;<i>Himmel</i>, vat a terrible mistake!
It is to her I owe it that I am de most celebrated
aeronaut in <i>der ganzeu welt</i>. It is the only profession in
wich I escape her <i>gewiss</i>. She haf de <i>kopf</i> too veak to rise
mit me. Ah, when I come oop here, it is <i>Himmel</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather taking an unfair rise out of your partner, isn&#39;t
it?&quot; queried the <i>Moon</i>-man with a sickly smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And vat vould you haf done in&mdash;<i>was sagt man</i>&mdash;in my
shoes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Moon</i>-man winced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not put them on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not yourself married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Moon</i>-man winced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I&#39;m only engaged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Mein herr</i>,&quot; said the old German solemnly, &quot;I haf nodings
but drouble from you. You make to me mein life von
burden. But I cannot see you going to de altar widout
putting out de hand to safe you. It was stupid to yourself
engage at all&mdash;but, now dat you haf committed de
mistake, shtick to it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep yourself engaged. Do not change your gondition
any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you say, Lord Silverdale?&quot; said the <i>Moon</i>-man,
anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am hardly an authority. You see I have so rarely been
married. It depends on the character of your betrothed.
Does she long to be of service in the world?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Moon</i>-man winced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that&#39;s why she fell in love with me. Thought a
<i>Moon</i>-man must be all noble sentiment like the <i>Moon</i>
itself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is, then, young,&quot; said Silverdale, musingly. &quot;Is
she also beautiful?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
The <i>Moon</i>-man winced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bewitching. Why does your lordship ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because her services might be valuable as an Old
Maid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, if you could only get Diana to see it in that light!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You seem anxious to be rid of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do. I confess it. It has been growing on me for
some time. You see hers is a soul perpetually seeking
more light. She is always asking questions. This thirst
for information would be made only more raging by
marriage. You know what Stevenson says:&mdash;&#39;To marry
is to domesticate the Recording Angel.&#39; At present my
occupations keep me away from her&mdash;but she answers
my letters with as many queries as a &#39;Constant Reader.&#39;
She wants to know all I say, do, or feel, and I never see
her without having to submit to a string of inquiries. It&#39;s
like having to fill up a census paper once a week. If I
don&#39;t see her for a fortnight she wants to know how I am
the moment we meet. If this is so before marriage, what
will it be after, when her opportunities of buttonholing
me will be necessarily more frequent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I see nothing to complain of in that!&quot; said Lord
Silverdale. &quot;Tender solicitude for one&#39;s betrothed is the
usual thing with those really in love. You wouldn&#39;t like
her to be indifferent to what you were doing, saying,
feeling?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Moon</i>-man winced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, that&#39;s just the dilemma of it, Lord Silverdale. I
am afraid your lordship does not catch my drift. You
see, with another man, it wouldn&#39;t matter; as your lordship
says, he would be glad of it. But to me all that sort
of thing&#39;s &#39;shop.&#39; And I hate &#39;shop.&#39; It&#39;s hard enough
to be out interviewing all day, without being reminded of
its when you get home and want to put your slippers on
the fender and your feet inside them and be happy. No,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
if there&#39;s one thing in this world I can&#39;t put up with, it&#39;s
&#39;shop&#39; after business hours. I want to forget that I get
my gold in exchange for notes of interrogation. I shudder
to be reminded that there are such things in the world as
questions&mdash;I tremble if I hear a person invert the subject
and predicate of a sentence. I can hardly bear to read
poetry because the frequent inversions make the lines
look as if they were going to be inquisitive. Now you
understand why I was so discourteous to your lordship,
and I trust that you will pardon the curt expression of
my hyper-sensitive feelings. Now, too, you understand
why I shrink from the prospect of marriage, to the brink
of which I once bounded so heedlessly. No, it is evident
a life of solitude must be my portion. If I am ever to
steep my wearied spirit in forgetfulness of my daily grind,
if my nervous system is to be preserved from premature
break-down, I must have no one about me who has a right of
interrogation, and my housekeeper must prepare my meals
without even the preliminary &#39;Chop or Steak, sir?&#39; My
home-life must be restful, peaceful, balsamic&mdash;it must
exhale a papaverous aroma of categorical proposition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But is there no way of getting a wife with a gift of
categorical conversation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please say, &#39;There is no way, etc.,&#39; for unless you
yourself speak categorically, the sentences grate upon my
ear. I can ask questions myself, without experiencing the
slightest inconvenience, but the moment I am myself interrogated,
every nerve in me quivers with torture. No, I
am afraid it is impossible to find a woman who will
eschew the interrogative form of proposition, and limit
herself to the affirmative and negative varieties; who will,
for mere love of me, invariably place the verb after the
noun, and unalterably give the subject the precedence
over the predicate. Often and often, when my Diana, in
all her dazzling charms, looks up pleadingly into my face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
I feel towards her as Ahasuerus felt towards the suppliant
Queen Esther, and I yearn to stretch out my reporter&#39;s
pencil towards her, and to say: &#39;Ask me what you will&mdash;even
if it be half my income&mdash;so long as you do not ask
me a question.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But isn&#39;t there&mdash;I mean there is&mdash;such a thing obtainable
as a dumb wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mutes are for funerals, and not for marriages. Besides,
then, everybody would be asking me why I married her.
No, the more I think of it, the more I see the futility of
my dream of matrimonial felicity. Why, a question lies
at the very threshold of marriage&mdash;&#39;Wilt thou have this
woman to be thy wedded wife?&#39;&mdash;and to put up the
banns is to loose upon yourself an interviewer in a white-tie!
No, leave me to my unhappy destiny. I must dree
my weird. And anything your lordship can do in the way
of enabling me to dree it by soliciting my Diana into the
Old Maids&#39; Club, shall be received with the warmest
thanksgiving and will allow me to remain your lordship&#39;s
most grateful and obedient servant, Daniel Wilkins.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Enough!&quot; said Lord Silverdale, deeply moved, &quot;I
will send her a circular. But do you really think you would
be happy if you lost her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If,&quot; said the <i>Moon</i>-man moodily. &quot;It would require
a great many &#39;ifs&#39; to make me happy. As I once wrote:</p>

<p class="indent">Your lordship might give me a poem in exchange,&quot; concluded
the <i>Moon</i>-man conceitedly. &quot;An advance quote

<p class="indent">At this point a sudden shock threw both bards off their
feet, inverting them in a manner most disagreeable to the
<i>Moon</i>-man. While they were dropping into poetry, the
balloon had been dropping into a wood, and the aeronaut
had thrown his grapnel into the branches of a tree.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; they cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Change here for London!&quot; said the Herr, phlegmatically,

&quot;No, no, put us down,&quot; said the <i>Moon</i>-man. &quot;I never

make that tunnel?&quot; Thereupon he lowered himself into
the tree, and Lord Silverdale followed his example.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Guten nacht!</i>&quot; said the Herr. &quot;Folkestone should
be someveres about. Fordunately, de moon is out, and
you may be able to find it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say!&quot; shrieked the <i>Moon</i>-man, as the balloon began
to free itself on its upward flight, &quot;How far off is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I vill not be&mdash;<i>was heist es?</i>&mdash;interviewed. <i>Guten
nacht.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Soon the great sphere was no bigger than a star in the
heavens.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is a nice go,&quot; said the <i>Moon</i>-man, when they had
climbed down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don&#39;t trouble. I know the Southeast coast well.
There is sure to be a town within a four mile radius.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then let us take a hansom,&quot; said the <i>Moon</i>-man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wilkins, are you&mdash;I mean you are&mdash;losing your head,&quot;
said Lord Silverdale. And linking the interviewer&#39;s arm
in his, he fared forth into the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know what I thought,&quot; said Wilkins, as they
undressed in the lonely roadside inn (for ballooning makes
us acquainted with strange bedfellows), &quot;when I was
sliding down the trunk with you on the branches above?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;what did you&mdash;I mean you did think what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m a bit superstitious, and I saw in the situation
a forecast of my future. That tree typifies my
genealogical tree, for when I have grown rich and prosperous
by my trade, there will be a peer perched somewhere
on the upper branches. Debrett will discover him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed I hope so,&quot; said the peer fervently, &quot;for in
the happy time when you shall have retired from business
you will be able to make Diana happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, we can&#39;t have Diana,&quot; the President said, when
Lord Silverdale reported the matter. &quot;That is, not if
the <i>Moon</i>-man breaks off the engagement. According
to the rules, the candidate must have herself discarded an
advantageous marriage, and that Miss Diana will give up
Mr. Wilkins is extremely questionable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Like everything connected with the <i>Moon</i>-man&#39;s bride.
However, my aerial expedition has not been fruitless; if I
have not brought you a member from the clouds, at least
we know how right I was to pluck Clorinda Bell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and how right I was to appoint you Honorary
Trier!&quot; said Lillie. &quot;I have several more candidates for
you, chosen from my last batch of applications. While
you were in the clouds, I was working. I have already interviewed
them. They fulfil all the conditions. It only
remains for you to do your part.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have they given good reasons for their refusal to
marry their lovers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excellent reasons. Reasons so strange as to bear the
stamp of truth. Here is the first reduced to writing. It
is compounded of what Miss Ellaline Rand said to me and
of what she left unsaid. Read it, while I put another of
these love stories into shape. I am so glad I founded the
Old Maids&#39; Club. It has enlarged my experience incalculably.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
When John Beveridge went to nurse his misanthropy
in the obscure fishing village of Trepolpen, he had not
bargained for the presence of Ellaline Rand. And yet
there she was, living in a queer little cottage on the very
top of the steep hill which constituted Trepolpen, and
sloped down to a pebbly beach where the dark nets dried
and the trawl boats were drawn up. The people she was
staying with were children of the soil and the sea&mdash;the
man, a rugged old fish-dealer who had been a smuggler
in his time; the woman, a chirpy grandame whose eyes
were still good enough to allow her to weave lace by lamplight.
The season was early June, and the glittering smile
on the broad face of the Atlantic made the roar of the
breakers sound like stentorian laughter. There was always
a whiff of fish&mdash;a blend of mackerel and crabs and mullet&mdash;striking
up from the beach, but the salt in the air kept
the odoriferous atoms fairly fresh. Everything in Trepolpen
was delightfully archaic, and even the far-away suggestions
of antiquity about the prevailing piscine flavor
seemed in poetic keeping with the spirit of the primitive
little spot.</p>

<p class="indent">In a village of one street it is impossible not to live in
it, unless you are a coastguard, and then you don&#39;t live in
the village. This was why John Beveridge was a neighbor
of Ellaline&#39;s. He lived much lower down, where the
laugh of the Atlantic was louder and the scent of the fish
was stronger, and before he knew of Ellaline&#39;s existence
he used to go down hill (which is easy), smoke his pipe and
chat with the trawlers, and lie on his back in the sun.
After they had met, he grew less lazy and used to take
exercise by walking up to the top of the hill. Probably by
this time the sea-breezes had given him strength. Sometimes
he met Ellaline coming down; which was accident.
Then he would turn and walk down with her; which was
design. The manner of their first meeting was novel, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
in such a place it could not be long delayed. Beveridge
had obeyed a call from the boatmen to come and help
them drag in the seine. He was tugging with all his
might at the section of the netting, for the fishers seemed
to be in luck and the fish unfortunate. Suddenly he heard
the pit-pat of light feet running down the hill, and the
next moment two little white hands peeping out of white
cuffs were gripping the net at the side of his own fleshy
brown ones. For some thirty seconds he was content to
divine the apparition from the hands. There was a flutter
of sweet expectation about his heart, a stirring of the sense
of romance.</p>

<p class="indent">The day was divine. The sky was a brooding blue;
the sea was a rippling play of light on which the seine-boat
danced lightly. One little brown sail was visible far
out in the bay, the sea-gulls hovering about it. It seemed
to Beveridge that the scene had only been waiting for
those gentle little hands, whose assistance in the operation
of landing the spoil was such a delicious farce. They
could be no native lass&#39;s, these soft fingers with their pink
little nails like pretty sea-pearls. They were fingers that
spoke (in their mute digital dialect) of the crayon and the
violin-bow, rather than of the local harmonium. There
was something, too, about the coquettish cuffs, irresistibly
at variance with the village Wesleyanism. Gradually, as
the net came in, Beveridge let his eyes steal towards her
face. The prevision of romance became a certainty. It
was a charming little face, as symmetrically proportioned
to the hands as the face of a watch is. The nose was retroussé
and piquant, but the eyes contradicted it, being
demure and dreamy. There was a little Cupid&#39;s bow of
a mouth, and between the half-parted rosy lips a gleam of
white teeth clenched with the exertion of hauling in the
seine. A simple sailor&#39;s hat crowned a fluff of flaxen hair,
and her dress was of airy muslin.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
She was so absorbed in the glee of hauling in the fish
that it was some moments before she seemed to notice
that her neighbor&#39;s eyes were fixed upon her, and that
they were not set in the rugged tan of the local masculine
face. A little blush leapt into the rather pale cheeks and
went out again like a tiny spurt of rosy flame. Then she
strained more desperately than ever at the net. It was
soon ashore, with its wild and whirling mixture of mackerel,
soles, dabs, squids, turbot&mdash;John Beveridge was not certain
but what his heart was already among the things fluttering
there in the net at her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">While the trawlers were sorting out the fish, spreading
some on the beach and packing the mackerel in baskets,
Ellaline looked on, patently interested in everything but
her fellow amateur. After all, despite his shaggy coat and
the clay pipe in his mouth, he was of the town, towny;
some solicitor, artist, stockbroker, doctor, on a holiday;
perhaps, considering the time of year, only a clerk.
What she had come to Trepolpen for was something more
primitive. And he! Surely he had seen and loved pretty
women enough, not to stir an inch nearer this dainty
vision. For what but to forget the wiles and treacheries
of women of the town had he buried himself here? And
yet was it the unexpectedness, was it that while bringing
back the atmosphere of great cities she yet seemed a
creature of the woods and waters, he felt himself drawn to
her? He wanted to talk to her, to learn who she was and
what she was doing here, but he did not know how to
begin, though he had the gift of many tongues. Not that
he deemed an introduction necessary&mdash;in Trepolpen,
where not to give everybody you met &quot;good-morning&quot;
was to court a reputation for surliness. And it would have
been easy enough to open on the weather, or the marine
harvest they had both helped to gather in. But somehow
John Beveridge learnt embarrassment in the presence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
this muslined mermaiden, who seemed half of the world
and half of the sea. And so, amid the bustle of the beach,
the minutes slipped away, and Beveridge spoke no word
but leaned against the cliff, content to drowse in the light
of the sun and Ellaline.</p>

<p class="indent">The dealers came down to the beach&mdash;men and women&mdash;among
them a hale, grizzly old fellow who clasped Ellaline&#39;s
hand in his huge, gnarled fist. The auction began.
John Beveridge joined the crowd at a point behind the
strangely assorted couple. Of a sudden Ellaline turned
to him with her great limpid eyes looking candidly into
his, and said, &quot;Some of those poor mackerel are not quite
dead yet&mdash;I wonder if they suffer.&quot; John Beveridge was
taken aback. The last vestiges of his wonted assurance
were swept away before her sweet simplicity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;really&mdash;I don&#39;t know&mdash;I&#39;ve never thought about
it,&quot; he stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men never do,&quot; said Ellaline with a gentle reproachful
look. &quot;They think only of their own pain. I do hope
fish have no feelings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are cold-blooded,&quot; he reminded her, beginning
to recover himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; she said musingly. &quot;But what right have we
to take away their lives? They must be&mdash;oh so happy!&mdash;in
the beautiful wide ocean! I am sorry I had a hand in
destroying them. I shall never do it again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have very little to reproach yourself with,&quot; he
said, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! now you are laughing at me. I know I&#39;m not big
and strong, and that my muscles could have been dispensed
with. But the will was there, the intention was
there,&quot; she said with her serious air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, of course, you are a piscicide in intention,&quot; he
admitted. &quot;But you will enjoy the mackerel all the
same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
&quot;No, I won&#39;t,&quot; she said with a charming little shake of
the head, &quot;I won&#39;t eat any.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! you will nevermore eat fish?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never,&quot; she said emphatically. &quot;I love fish, but I
won&#39;t eat &#39;em! only tinned things, like sardines. Oh, what
a little stupid I am! Don&#39;t laugh at me again, please. I
forgot the sardines must be caught first, before they are
tinned, mustn&#39;t they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; he said. &quot;It often suffices if sprats
are caught.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed. Her laugh was a low musical ripple, like
one of the little sunlit waves translated into sound.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twenty-two shillings!&quot; cried the owner of a lot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll give &#39;ee eleven!&quot; said Ellaline&#39;s companion, and
the girl turned her head to listen to the violent chaffering
that ensued, and when she went away she only gave John
Beveridge a nod and a smile. But he followed her with
his eyes as she toiled up the hill, growing ever smaller and
daintier against the horizon. The second time he met her
was at the Cove, a little way from the village, where great
foliage-crowned cliffs came crescent-wise round a space
of shining sand, girdled at its outer margin by tumbling
green, foam-crested surges. Huge mammoth-like boulders
stood about, bathing their feet in the incoming tide, the
cormorants perching cautiously down the precipitous half-worn
path that led to the sands. There was a point at
which the landward margin of the shore beneath first
revealed itself to the descending pedestrian, and it was a
point so slippery that it was thoughtless of Fate to have
included Ellaline in the area of vision. She was lying,
sheltered by a blue sunshade, on the golden sand, with her
head on the base of the cliff, abstractedly tearing a long
serpentine weed to dark green ribbons, and gazing out
dreamily into the throbbing depths of sea and sky. There
was an open book before her, but she did not seem to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
reading. John Beveridge saved himself by grasping a
stinging bush, and he stole down gently towards her, forgetting
to swear.</p>

<p class="indent">He came to her with footsteps muffled by the soft sand,
and stood looking down at her, admiring the beauty of the
delicate flushed young face and the flaxen hair against the
sober background of the aged cliff with its mellow subtly-fused
tints.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thinking of the little fishes&mdash;or of the gods?&quot; he said
at last in a loud pleasant voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Ellaline gave a little shriek.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, where did you spring from?&quot; she said, half raising
herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not from the clouds,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not. I was <i>not</i> thinking of the gods,&quot; said
Ellaline.</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed. &quot;I am not even a Perseus,&quot; he said, &quot;for
the tide though coming in is not yet dangerous enough to
be likened to the sea-monster, though you might very well
pass for Andromeda.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ellaline blushed and rose to her feet, adjusting a wrap
round her shoulders. &quot;I do not know,&quot; she said with dignity,
&quot;what I have done to encourage such a comparison.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Beveridge saw he had slipped. This time there
was not even a stinging bush to cling to.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are beautiful, that is all I meant,&quot; he said apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it worth while saying such commonplace things?&quot;
she said a little mollified.</p>

<p class="indent">It was an ambiguous remark. From her it could only
mean that he had been guilty of compliment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very sorry. A thousand pardons. But, pray, do
not let me drive you away. You seemed so happy here.
I will go back.&quot; He made a half turn.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
&quot;Yes, I was happy,&quot; she said simply. &quot;In my foolish
little way I thought I had discovered this spot&mdash;as if anything
so beautiful could have escaped the attention of those
who have been near it all their lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her words caused him a sudden pang of anxious jealousy.
Must they not be true of herself?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you, too, seemed to have discovered it,&quot; she went
on. &quot;Doubtless you know all the coast well, for you were
here before me. Do you know,&quot; she said, looking up at
his face with her candid gray eyes, &quot;this is the first time
in my life I have seen the sea, so you must not laugh if I
seem ignorant, but oh! how I love to lie and hear it roar,
tossing its mane like some great wild animal that I have
tamed and that will not harm me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are other wild animals that you may tame, here
by the sea,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">She considered for a moment gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is rather pretty,&quot; she announced. &quot;I shall re-remember
that. But please do not tell me again I am beautiful.&quot;
She sat down on the sand, with her back to the cliff,
re-adjusting her parasol.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. I sit reproved,&quot; he replied, taking up his
position by her side. &quot;What book is that you are reading?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She handed him the little paper-covered, airily-printed
volume, suggesting summer in every leaf.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, it is <i>The Cherub That Sits Up Aloft</i>!&quot; he said,
with a shade of superciliousness blent with amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, have you read it?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;I have heard of it. It&#39;s by that new
woman who came out last year and calls herself Andrew
Dibdin, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Ellaline. &quot;It&#39;s made an enormous hit, don&#39;t
you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, I know,&quot; he said, laughing. &quot;It&#39;s a lot of
sentimental rot, isn&#39;t it? Do you like it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
&quot;I think it is sweetly pretty,&quot; she said, a teardrop of
vexation gathering on her eyelid. &quot;If you haven&#39;t read
it, why should you abuse it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, one can&#39;t read everything,&quot; he said. &quot;But one
gets to pick up enough about a book to know whether he
cares to read it. Of course, I am aware it is about a little
baby on board a ship that makes charming inarticulate
orations and is worshipped by everybody, from the captain
to the little stowaway, and is regarded by the sailors as
the sweet little cherub that sits up aloft, etc., and that
there is a sensational description of a storm at sea&mdash;which
is Clarke Russell and water, or rather Clarke Russell and
more water.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, I see you&#39;re a cynic,&quot; said Ellaline. &quot;I don&#39;t like
cynics.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed, I am not,&quot; he pleaded. &quot;It is false, not
true, sentiment I object to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how do you know this is false sentiment?&quot; she
asked in honest indignation. &quot;When you haven&#39;t read
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does it matter?&quot; he murmured, overwhelmed
by her sense of duty. She was evidently unaccustomed
to the light flippancies of elegant conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, nothing. To some people nothing matters. Will
you promise to read the book if I lend it you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I will,&quot; he said, delighted at the establishment
of so permanent a link. &quot;Only I don&#39;t want to
deprive you of it&mdash;I can wait till you have finished with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have finished. I have read it over and over again.
Take it.&quot; She handed it to him. Their finger-tips met.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I recant already,&quot; he said. &quot;It must have something
pure and good in it to take captive a soul like yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And indeed the glamour of Ellaline was over every page
of it. As he read, he found tears of tenderness in his
eyes, when otherwise they might have sprung from laughter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
He adored the little cherub who sat up aloft on the
officers&#39; table and softened these crusty sea-dogs whose
hearts were become as ship&#39;s-biscuits. He could not tell
what had come over himself, that his own sere heart
should be so quick again to the beauties of homely virtue
and duty, to the engaging simplicity and pathos of childhood,
to the purity of womanhood. Was it that Ellaline
was all these things incarnate?</p>

<p class="indent">He avowed his error and his conversion, and gradually
they came to meet often in the solitary creek, as was but
right for the only two intellectual people in Trepolpen.
Sometimes, too, they wandered further afield, amid the
ferny lanes. But the Cove was their favorite trysting
place, and there lying with his head in her lap, he would
talk to her of books and men and one woman.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Talked to her of books and men and one woman.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">He found her tastes were not limited to <i>The Cherub
That Sits Up Aloft</i>, for she liked Meredith. &quot;Really,&quot;
he said, &quot;if you had not been yourself, I should have
doubted whether your admiration was genuine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, his women are so real. But I do not pretend to
care for the style.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Style!&quot; he said, &quot;I call it a five-barred fence. To
me style is everything. Style alone is literature, whether
it be the man or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, then you are of the school of Addiper?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, have you heard of that? I am. I admire Addiper
and agree with him. Form is everything&mdash;literature
is only a matter of form. And a book is only a form of
matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;But I adore Addiper myself,
though I regret the future seems likely to be his. I
have read all he has written. Every line is so lucid.
The form is exquisite. But as for the matter&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No matter!&quot; summed up John Beveridge, laughing
heartily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
&quot;I am so glad you agree with me sometimes,&quot; said
Ellaline. &quot;Because it shows you don&#39;t think I am so
very stupid after all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I don&#39;t&mdash;except when you get so enthusiastic
about literary people and rave about Dibdin and Addiper
and Blackwin and the rest. If you mixed with them,
my little girl, as I have done, you would soon lose your
rosy illusions. Although perhaps you are better with
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, then you&#39;re not a novelist yourself?&quot; she said
anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I am not. What makes you ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing. Only sometimes, from your conversation,
I suspected you might be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Ellaline,&quot; he said, &quot;for a very dubious
compliment. No, I am afraid I must forego that claim
upon your admiration. Unless I tell a lie and become
a novelist by doing so. But then wouldn&#39;t it be the
truth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you, then, a painter or a musician?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head. &quot;No, I do not get my living by
art.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not of any kind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not of any kind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How <i>do</i> you get it?&quot; she asked simply, a candid light
shining in the great gray eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father was a successful saddle-maker. He is
dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leather has made me, from childhood up&mdash;it has
chastised, supported, educated me, and given me the
<i>entrée</i> everywhere. So you see I cannot hold a candle to
your demigods.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, but there is nothing like leather,&quot; said Ellaline,
and stroked the head in her lap reassuringly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
The assurance permeated John Beveridge&#39;s frame like
a pleasant cordial. All that was hard and leathery in him
seemed to be soaked soft. Here, at last, was a woman
who loved him for himself&mdash;an innocent, trusting woman
in whose weakness a man might find strength. Her pure
lips were like the wayside well at which the wearied wanderer
from great stony cities might drink and be refreshed.
And yet, delightful as her love would be in his
droughty life, he felt that his could not prove less delightful
to her. That he, John Beveridge, with the roses
thrusting themselves into his eyes, should stoop to pick
the simple little daisy at his feet, could not fail to fill
her with an admiring gratitude that would add the last
charm to her passion for him.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was not till a week afterwards that the formal
proposal, so long impending, broke. They were resting in a
lane and discussing everything they didn&#39;t want to discuss,
the unspoken playing with subtle sweetness about
the spoken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you read Mr. Gladstone&#39;s latest?&quot; she asked at
last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; he said; &quot;has Mr. Gladstone ever a latest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, take him day by day, like an evening paper.
I&#39;m referring to his article on &#39;Ancient Beliefs in a Future
State.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s that&mdash;the belief of old maids that they&#39;ll get
married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you are blasphemous,&quot; she cried with a pretty
pout.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How? Are old maids a sacred subject?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything old should be sacred to us,&quot; she said
simply. &quot;But you know that is not what I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why do you say it?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what a tease you are!&quot; she cried. &quot;I shan&#39;t be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
sorry to be quit of you. Your flippancy is quite dreadful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, do you believe in a future state?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I do. If we had only one life, it would not
be worth living.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But nine times one life <i>would</i> be worth living. Is
that the logic? If so, happy cats! I wonder,&quot; he added
irrelevantly, &quot;why the number nine always goes with cats&mdash;nine
lives, nine tails, nine muses?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ellaline made a <i>moue</i> and shrank petulantly away from
him. &quot;I will not discuss our future state, unless you are
prepared to do it seriously,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am,&quot; he replied with sudden determination. &quot;Let
us enter it together. I am tired of the life I&#39;ve been leading,
and I love you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; she said in a little horrified whisper. &quot;You
want us to commit suicide together?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no&mdash;matrimony. I cannot do it alone&mdash;I have
never had the courage to do it at all. With you at my
side, I should go forward, facing the hereafter cheerfully,
with faith and trust.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;afraid&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&quot; she stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should you be afraid?&quot; he interrupted.
&quot;Have you no faith and trust in me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she said with a frank smile, &quot;if I had not
confidence in you, I should not be here with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You angel!&quot; he said, his eyes growing wet under
her clear, limpid gaze. &quot;But you love me a little,
too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not,&quot; she said, shaking her head demurely.</p>

<p class="indent">John Beveridge groaned. After so decisive an avowal
from the essence of candor, what remained to be said?
Nothing but to bid her and his hopes farewell&mdash;the latter
at once, the former as soon as she was escorted back to
Trepolpen. His affection had grown so ripe, he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
not exchange it for the green fruit of friendship. And
yet, was this to be the end of all that sweet idyllic interlude,
a jarring note and then silence for evermore?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But could you never learn to love me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed her girlish, ringing laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not so backward as all that,&quot; she said. &quot;I mastered
it in a dozen lessons.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stared at her, a wild hope kindling in his eyes.
&quot;Did I hear aright?&quot; he asked in a horse tone.</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded, still smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I did not hear aright before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, you did. I said I did not love you a little.
I love you a great deal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There were tears in the gray eyes now, but they smiled
on. He caught her in his arms and the Devonshire lane
was transformed to Eden. How exquisite this angelic
frankness, when the words pleased! How delicious the
frankness of her caress when words were <i>de trop</i>!</p>

<p class="indent">But at last she spoke again. &quot;And now that I know
you love me for myself, I will tell you a secret.&quot; The
little hands that had first clasped his attention were laid
on his shoulders, the dreamy face looked up tenderly and
proudly into his. &quot;They say a woman cannot keep a
secret,&quot; she said. &quot;But you will never believe that again,
when I tell you mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never believed it,&quot; he said earnestly. &quot;Consider
how every woman keeps the great secret of her age.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that is not what I am going to tell you,&quot; she said
archly. &quot;It is another of the great secrets of my age.
You remember that book you liked so much&mdash;<i>The Cherub
That Sits Up Aloft</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes!&quot; he said wonderingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I wrote it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You!&quot; he exclaimed, startled. His image of her
seemed a pillar of sand upon which the simoom had burst.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
This fresh, simple maiden a complex literary being, a
slave of the midnight lamp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I&mdash;I am Andrew Dibdin&mdash;the authoress who
drew tears from your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You, Andrew Dibdin!&quot; he repeated mechanically.</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded her head with a proud and happy smile. &quot;I
knew you would be pleased&mdash;but I wanted you to love me,
not my book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love both,&quot; he exclaimed. The new conceptions
had fitted themselves into the old. He saw now what the
charm of the little novel was&mdash;the book was Ellaline between
covers. He wondered he had not seen it before.
The grace, the purity, the pathos, the sweet candor, the
recollections of a childhood spent on the great waters in
the company of kindly mariners&mdash;all had flowed out at
the point of her pen. She had put herself into her work.
He felt a subtle jealousy of the people who bought her on
the bookstalls for a shilling&mdash;or even for ninepence at the
booksellers&#39;. He wanted to have her all to himself. He
experienced a mad desire to buy up the edition. But
there would be a new one. He realized the feelings of
Othello. Oh, if he could but arrest her circulation!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you knew how happy it made me to hear you say
you love my book!&quot; she replied. &quot;At first I hated you
because you sneered at it. All my friends love my books&mdash;and
I wanted you to be a friend of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am more than that,&quot; he said exultantly. &quot;And I
want to love all your books. What else have you written?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only two others,&quot; she said apologetically. &quot;You see
I have only been in literature six months and I only
write straight from the heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; he said. &quot;You wear your heart upon
your leaves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jealous as he was of her readers, he felt that there was
balm in Gilead. She was not a hack-writer, turning out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
books for the market of malice aforethought; not the
complex being he had figured in the first moment of consternation,
the literary quack with finger on the pulse of
the public. She did but write as the birds carolled&mdash;not
the slave, but the genius of the midnight lamp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I must not wear my heart out,&quot; she replied,
laughingly. &quot;So I came down here for a month to get
fresh material. I am writing a novel of Cornish peasant
life&mdash;I want to photograph the people with all their
lights and shades, all their faiths and superstitions, all
their ways of speech and thought&mdash;the first thorough
study ever made of a fast-fading phase of Old English
life. You see, I didn&#39;t know what to do; I feared the
public would be tired of my sailor-stories and I thought
I&#39;d locate my next story on land. Accident determined
its environment. I learnt, by chance, that we had some
poor relatives in Trepolpen, whom my people had dropped,
and so I thought I&#39;d pick them up again, and turn them
into &#39;copy,&#39; and I welcomed the opportunity of making
at the same time the acquaintance of the sea, which, as I
think I told you, I have never seen before. You see I
was poor myself till <i>The Cherub That Sits Up Aloft</i>
showered down the gold, and, being a Cockney, had
never been able to afford a trip to the seaside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My poor Ellaline!&quot; he said, kissing her candid lips.
She was such an inveterate truth-teller that he could
only respect and admire and adore&mdash;though she fell from
heaven. Her candor infected him. He felt an overwhelming
paroxysm of veracity.</p>

<p class="indent">The mask could be dropped now. Did she not love
John Beveridge?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I see why you rave so over literary people!&quot; he
said. &quot;You are dipped in ink yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said with a happy smile, &quot;there is nobody
I admire so much as our great writers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
&quot;But you would not love me more, if I were a great
writer?&quot; he said anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, certainly not. I couldn&#39;t,&quot; she said decisively.</p>

<p class="indent">He stooped and kissed her gratefully. &quot;Thank you
for that, my sweet Ellaline. And now I think I can
safely confess that I am Addiper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She gave a little shriek. Her face turned white.
&quot;Addiper!&quot; she breathed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, dearest, it is my <i>nom de guerre</i>. I am Addiper,
the writer you admire so much, the man with whose
school, you were pleased to say, the future lies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Addiper!&quot; she said again. &quot;Impossible! why you
said you did not get your living by art of any kind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I don&#39;t!&quot; he said. &quot;Books like mine&mdash;all
style, no sentiment, morals or theology&mdash;never pay. Fortunately
I am able to publish them at my own expense.
I write only for writers. That is why you like me.
Successful writers are those who write for readers, just as
popular painters are those who paint for spectators.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The poor little face was ashen gray now. The surprise
was too much for the fragile little beauty. &quot;Then you
really are Addiper!&quot; she said in low, slow tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, dearest,&quot; he said not without a touch of pride.
&quot;I am Addiper&mdash;and in you, love, I have found a fresh
fount of inspiration. You shall be the guiding star of my
work, my rare Ellaline, my pearl, my beryl. Ah, this is a
great turning-point in my life. To-day I enter into my
third manner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is not one of your teasing jokes?&quot; she said
appealingly, her piteous eyes looking up into his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, my Ellaline. Do you think I would hoax you
thus&mdash;to dash you to earth again?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then,&quot; she said slowly and painfully, &quot;then I can
never marry you. We must say &#39;good-bye.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her lover gazed at her in dazed silence.  The butterflies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
floated in the summer air, a bee buzzed about a wayside
flower, from afar came the tinkle of a brook. A deep
peace was on all things&mdash;only in the hearts of the two
littérateurs was pain and consternation.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Confession of Ellaline.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can never marry me!&quot; repeated John Beveridge
at last. &quot;And why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have told you. Because you are Addiper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that is no reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it not?&quot; she said. &quot;I thought Addiper would
have a subtler apprehension.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what is it you object to in me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To your genius, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To my genius!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, no mock modesty. Between augurs it won&#39;t do.
Every author must know very well he stands apart from
the world, or he would not set himself to paint it. I know
quite well I am not as other women. What is the use of
paltering with one&#39;s consciousness!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still the same delicious candor shone in the gray eyes.
John Beveridge, not at all grasping his dismissal, felt an
unreasoning impulse to kiss them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, supposing I am a genius,&quot; he said instead.
&quot;Where&#39;s the harm?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No harm till you propose to yoke me with it! I never
will marry a genius.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be so absurd, Ellaline!&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;ve
been reading the foolish nonsense about the geniuses necessarily
making bad husbands. No doubt in some prominent
instances geniuses have not been working models of
the domestic virtues, but on the other hand there are scores
of instances to the contrary. And blockheads make quite
as bad husbands as your Shelleys and your Byrons. Besides
it was only in the past that geniuses were blackguards;
to-day it is the correct thing to be correct. Respectability
nowadays adds chastity to the studies from the nude;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
marital fidelity enhances the force of poems of passion:
and philanthropy adds the last touch to tragic acting. So
why should I suffer for the sins of my predecessors? If
I may judge myself by my present sensations, what I am
gifted with is a genius for domesticity. Do not sacrifice
me, dearest, to an unproved and unscientific generalization.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not of that I am thinking,&quot; Ellaline replied, shaking
her head sadly. &quot;In my opinion the woman who
refused Shakespeare merely on the ground that he wrote
Shakespeare&#39;s works, should be sent to Coventry as a
coward. No, do not fancy I am that. I may not be strong,
but I have courage enough to marry you if that were all.
It is not because I am afraid you would make me unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, there is something you are hiding from me,&quot; he
said anxiously, impressed by the gravity and sincerity of
her tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, there is nothing. I cannot marry you, because you
are a genius.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He saw what she meant now. She had been reading
the modern works on genius and insanity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you think me mad!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mad&mdash;when you love me?&quot; she said, with a melancholy
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know what I mean. You think that &#39;great wits
to madness nearly are allied,&#39; that sane as I appear, there
is in me a hidden vein of madness. And yet, if anything,
the generalization connecting genius with insanity is more
unsound than that connecting it with domestic infelicity.
It would require a genius to really prove such a connection,
and as he would, on his own theory, be a lunatic,
what becomes of his theory?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your argument involves a fallacy,&quot; replied Ellaline
quietly. &quot;It does not follow that if a man is a lunatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
everything he says or does has the taint of madness. A
genius who held that genius meant insanity might be sane
just on this one point.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or insane just on the one point. Seriously, Ellaline,&quot;
said John Beveridge, beginning to lose his temper, &quot;you
don&#39;t mean to say that you believe that genius is really &#39;a
psychical neurosis of the epileptoid order.&#39; If you do you
must be mad yourself, that&#39;s all I can say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I should have to admit I am mad myself if
I held the theory that genius meant insanity. But I
don&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t!&quot; he said, staring blankly at her. &quot;You
don&#39;t believe I&#39;m insane, and you don&#39;t believe I&#39;ll make
a bad husband&mdash;I should be insane if I did, my sweet little
Ellaline. And you still wish to cry off?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you no longer love me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I beg of you, do not say that! You do not know
how hard it is for me to give you up&mdash;do not make our
parting harder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ellaline, in heaven&#39;s name vex me no further. What
is this terrible mystery? Why can you no longer think of
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you only thought of me a little you would guess.
But men are so selfish. If it were only you that had genius
the thing would be simple. But you forget that I, too&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
She paused; a little modest blush completed the sentence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know you are a genius, my rare Ellaline. But
what then?&quot; he cried. &quot;I only love you the more for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but if we marry,&quot; said Ellaline, &quot;we two geniuses,
look what will happen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stared at her afresh&mdash;she met his gaze unflinchingly.
&quot;What new scientific bogie have you been conjuring up.&quot;
he murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I wish you would drive science out of your head,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
she replied pettishly. &quot;What have I to do with science?
Really, if you go on so stupidly I shall believe you&#39;re not
a genius after all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then you will marry me?&quot; he said eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be so stupid! To speak plainly, for you seem
as dull as a clod-hopper to-day, I cannot afford to marry
a genius, and a recognized genius to boot. I am only a
struggling young authoress, with a considerable following,
it is true, but still without an unquestioned position. The
high-class organs that review you all to yourself still take
me as one of a batch and are not always as complimentary
as they might be. The moment I marry you and my rushlight
is hidden in your bushel, out it goes. I become absorbed
simply in you, a little satellite circling round your
planetary glory. I shall have no independent existence&mdash;the
fame I have toiled and struggled for will be eclipsed
in yours. &#39;Mrs. Addiper&mdash;the wife of the celebrated writer,
scribbles a little herself, don&#39;t you know! Wonder what
he could see in her!&#39; That&#39;s how people will talk of me.
When I go into a room we shall be announced, &#39;Mr. and
Mrs. Addiper&#39;&mdash;and everybody will rush round you and
hang on your words, and I shall be talked to only by the
way of getting you at second-hand, as a medium through
which your personality is partially radiated. And parties
will be given &#39;To meet Mr. Addiper,&#39; and I shall accompany
you for the same reason that your dress-coat will&mdash;because
it is the etiquette.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Ellaline&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he protested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me finish. I could not even afford to marry you,
if my literary position were equal to yours. Such a union
would do nothing to enhance my reputation. No woman
of genius should marry a man of genius&mdash;were she even
the greater of the two she would become merged in him,
even as she would take his name. The man I must marry,
the man I have been waiting to fall in love with and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
loved by, is a plain honest gentleman, unknown to fame
and innocent of all aspiration but that of making me happy.
He must devote his life to mine, sink himself in me, sacrifice
himself on the altar of my fame, live only for the enhancement
of my reputation. Such a man I thought I had
found in you&mdash;but you deceived me. I thought here is a
man who loves me only for myself, but whose love will increase
tenfold when he learns that I stand on a pedestal of
glory, and who will rejoice at the privilege of passing the rest
of his days uplifting that pedestal to the gaze of the world,
a man who will say of me what I can hardly say of myself,
who will drive the bargains with my publishers, wrap me
up against the knowledge of malicious criticisms, conduct
my correspondence, receive inconvenient callers, arrange
my interviews, and send incessant paragraphs to the papers
about me, commencing Mrs. John Beveridge (Andrew Dibdin),
varied by Andrew Dibdin (Mrs. John Beveridge).
Here is a man who will be a living gratuitous advertisement,
inserted daily in the great sheets of the times, a steadfast
column of eulogy, a pillar of praise. Here is a man
who will be as much a halo as a husband. When I enter
a drawing-room with him (so ran my innocent, maiden
dream) there will be a thrill of excitement, everybody will
cluster round me, he will efface himself or be effaced, and,
even if he finds anybody to talk to, it is about me he will
talk. Invitations to our own &#39;At Homes&#39; will be eagerly
sought for&mdash;not for his sake, but for mine. All that is
famous in literature and art will crowd our salon&mdash;not for
his sake, but for mine. And while I shall be the cynosure
of every eye, it will be his to note down the names of
the illustrious gazers in society paragraphs beginning Mrs.
John Beveridge (Andrew Dibdin), alternating with Andrew
Dibdin (Mrs. John Beveridge). And am I to give up all
this, merely because I love you?&quot;</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, why not!&quot; he said passionately. &quot;What is fame,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
reputation, weighed against love? What is it to be on
the World&#39;s lips, if the lips we love are to be taken away?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How pretty!&quot; she said with simple admiration. &quot;If
you will not claim the phrase, I should like to give it to
my next heroine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Claim it!&quot; he said bitterly. &quot;I do not want any
phrases. I want you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you not see it is impossible? If you could become
obscure again, it might be. You say fame is nothing
weighed against love. Come now, would you give up
your genius, your reputation, just to marry me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was silent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come!&quot; she repeated. &quot;I have been frank with you,
have I not!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have,&quot; he admitted, with a melancholy grimace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, be equally frank with me. Would you sacrifice
these things to your love for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could not if I would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But would you, if you could?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course you wouldn&#39;t,&quot; she said. &quot;I know you as
I know myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the use of thinking of what can never be!&quot;
he said impatiently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just so. That is what I say. I can never give you
my hand; so give me yours and we&#39;ll turn homewards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He gave her his hand and she jumped lightly to her
feet. Then he got up and shook himself, and looked still
in a sort of daze, at the gentle face and the dainty figure.</p>

<p class="indent">He seized her passionately by the arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And must this be the end?&quot; he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Finis,&quot; she said decisively, though the renewed pallor
of her face showed what it cost her to complete the idyl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An unhappy ending?&quot; he said in hopeless interrogation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
&quot;It is not my style,&quot; she said simply, &quot;but, after all,
this is only real life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He burst forth in a torrent of half reproachful regrets&mdash;he,
Addiper, the chaste, the severe, the self-contained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you the sweet, innocent girl who won the heart I
no longer hoped to feel living, you would coldly abandon
the love for whose existence you are responsible! You,
who were to be so fresh and pure an influence on my
work, are content to deprive literature of those masterpieces
our union would have called into being! Oh, but
you cannot unshackle yourself thus from my life&mdash;for good
or evil your meeting with me determined my third manner.
Hitherto I thought it was for good; now I fear it will be
for evil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You seem to have forgotten <i>all</i> your manners,&quot; she
said, annoyed. &quot;And if our meeting was for evil, at least
our parting shall be for good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Beveridge and Ellaline Rand spake no more, but
walked home in silence through the country lanes on
which the sunlight seemed to lie cold. The past was but
a dream&mdash;not for these two the simple emotions which
cross with joy or sorrow the web of common life. At the
cottage near the top of the hill, where the sounds and
scents of the sea were faintest, they parted. The idyl of
Trepolpen was ended.</p>

<p class="indent">And John Beveridge went downhill.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center">MORE ABOUT THE CHERUB.</p>

<p class="indent">The trial interview between Lord Silverdale and Ellaline
Rand took place in the rooms of the Old Maids&#39; Club
in the presence of the President. Lillie, encouraged by
the rush of candidates, occupied herself in embroidering
another epigrammatic antimacassar&mdash;&quot;It is man who is
vain of woman&#39;s dress.&quot; She had deliberately placed herself
out of earshot. To Miss Rand, Lord Silverdale was
a casual visitor with whom she had drifted into conversation,
yet she behaved as prettily as if she knew she was
undergoing the <i>viva-voce</i> portion of the examination for
entranceship.</p>

<p class="indent">There are two classes of flirts&mdash;those who love to flirt,
and those who flirt to love. There is little to be said
against the latter, for they are merely experimenting. They
intend to fall in love, but they can hardly compass it without
preliminary acquaintance, and by giving themselves a
wide and varied selection, are more likely to discover the
fitting object of affection. It is easy to confound both
classes of flirts together, and heartbroken lovers generally
do so, when they do not use a stronger expression. But
so far as Lord Silverdale could tell, there was nothing in
Miss Rand&#39;s behavior to justify him in relegating her
to either class, or to make him doubt the genuineness of
the anti-hymeneal feelings provoked by her disappointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
in Trepolpen. Her manner was simple and artless&mdash;she
gushed, indeed, but charmingly, like a daintily sculptured
figure on a marble fountain in a fair pleasaunce.
You could be as little offended by her gush, as by her
candid confessions of her own talents. The Lord had
given her a good conceit of herself, and given it her so
gracefully, that it was one of her chiefest charms. She
spoke with his lordship of Shakespeare and others of her
profession, and mentioned that she was about to establish
a paper called <i>The Cherub</i>, after her popular story <i>The
Cherub That Sits Up Aloft</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to get into closer touch with my readers,&quot; she explained,
helping herself charmingly to the chocolate creams.
&quot;In a book, you cannot get into direct <i>rapport</i> with your
public. Your characters are your rivals and distract attention
from the personality of the author. In a journal I shall
be able to chat with them freely, open my heart to them and
gather them to it. There is a legitimate curiosity to learn
all about me&mdash;the same curiosity that I feel about other
authors. Why should I allow myself to be viewed in the
refracting medium of alien ink? Let me sketch myself to
my readers, tell them what I eat and drink, and how I
write, and when, what clothes I wear and how much I pay
for them, what I think of this or that book of mine, of this
or that character of my creation, what my friends think of
me, and what I think of my friends. All the features of the
paper will combine to make my face. I shall occupy all the
stories, and every column will have me at the top. In this
way I hope, not only to gratify my yearnings for sympathy,
but to stimulate the circulation of my books. Nay more,
with the eye of my admirers thus encouragingly upon me, I
shall work more zealously. You see, Lord Silverdale, we
authors are a race apart&mdash;without the public hanging upon
our words, we are like butterflies in a London fog, or
actors playing to an empty auditorium.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
&quot;I have noticed that,&quot; said Lord Silverdale dryly, &quot;before
authors succeed, it takes them a year to write a book,
after they succeed it takes them only a month.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see I am right,&quot; said Ellaline eagerly. &quot;That&#39;s
what the sun of public sympathy does. It ripens work
quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and when the sun is very burning, it sometimes
takes the authors no time at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, now you are laughing at me. You are speaking
of &#39;ghosts.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Ghost stories are published all the year round&mdash;not
merely at Christmas. Don&#39;t think I&#39;m finding fault.
I look upon an author who keeps his ghost, as I do on a
tradesmen who keeps his carriage. It is a sign he has
succeeded.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but it&#39;s very wicked, giving the public underweight
like that!&quot; said Ellaline in her sweet, serious way. &quot;How
can anybody write as well as yourself? But why I mentioned
about <i>The Cherub</i> is because it has just struck me
the paper might become the organ of the Old Maids&#39; Club,
for I should make a point of speaking freely of my aims
and aspirations in joining it. I presume you know all
about Miss Dulcimer&#39;s scheme?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes! But I don&#39;t think it feasible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t?&quot; she said, with a little tremor of astonishment
in her voice. &quot;And why not?&quot; She looked anxiously
into his eyes for the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The candidates are too charming to remain single,&quot;
he explained, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled back a little at him, those sweet gray eyes
still looking into his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>You</i> are not a literary man?&quot; she said irrelevantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid I must plead guilty to trying to be,&quot; he
said. &quot;The evidence is down in black and white.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The smile died away and for an instant Ellaline&#39;s brow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
went into black for it. She accepted an ice from Turple
the magnificent, but took her leave shortly afterwards,
Lillie promising to write to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; said the President when she was left alone
with the Honorary Trier.</p>

<p class="indent">That functionary looked dubious. &quot;Up till the very last
she seemed single-hearted in her zeal. Then she asked
whether <i>I</i> was a literary man. You know her story. What
do you conclude?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can hardly come to a conclusion. Do you think
there is still a danger of her marrying to get someone to
advertise her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it depends on <i>The Cherub</i>. If <i>The Cherub</i> is
born and lives, it will be a more effectual advertising
medium than even a husband, and may replace him. A
paper of your own can puff you rather better than a husband
of your own, it has a larger circulation and more
opportunities. An authoress-editress, her worth is far
above rubies! Her correspondents praise her in the gates
and her staff shall rise up and call her blessed. It may
well be that she will arrive at that stage at which a husband
is an incubus and marriage a manacle. In that day the
honor of the Club will be safe in her hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you suggest then?&quot; said Lillie anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you wait till she is delivered of <i>The Cherub</i> before
deciding.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well,&quot; she replied resignedly. &quot;Only I hope
we shall be able to admit her. Her conception of the use
of man is so sublime!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Silverdale smiled. &quot;Ah, if the truth were known,&quot;
he said, &quot;I daresay it would be that pretty women regard
man merely as a beast of draught and burden, a creature
to draw their checks and carry their cloaks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie answered, &quot;And men look on pretty women
either as home pets or as drawing-room decorations.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
Silverdale said further, &quot;I do not look on you as
either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To which, Lillie, &quot;Why do you say such obvious
things? It is unworthy of you. Have you anything
worthy of you in your pocket to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing of your hearing. Just a little poem about
another Cherub.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think so? Then I will go and leave you to

<p class="indent">Lillie sat for a long time with pen in hand, thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
without writing. As a change from writing without thinking
this was perhaps a relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was Ellaline the girl who has just gone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you see her? I thought you were gardening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I was, but I happened to go into the dining-room

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="center">OF WIVES AND THEIR MISTRESSES.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no,&quot; said Miss Eustasia Pallas. &quot;You misapprehend
me. It is not because it would be necessary to
have a husband and a home of one&#39;s own, that I object
to marriage, but because it would be impossible to do
without servants. While a girl lives at home, she can
cultivate her soul while her mother attends to the <i>ménage</i>.
But after marriage, the higher life is impossible. You
must have servants. You cannot do your own dirty work&mdash;not
merely because it is dirty, but because it is the thief
of time. You can hardly get literature, music, and
religion adequately into your life even with the whole day
at your disposal; but if you had to make your own bed,
too, I am afraid you wouldn&#39;t find time to lie on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why object to servants?&quot; inquired Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because servants are the asphyxiators of the soul.
But for them I should long since have married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not quite follow you. Surely if you had servants
to relieve you of all the grosser duties, the spiritual could
then claim your individual attention.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that is a pretty theory. It sounds very plausible.
In practice, alas! it does not work. Like the servants. I
have kept my eyes open almost from the first day of my
life. I have observed my mother&#39;s household and other
people&#39;s&mdash;I speak of the great middle-classes, mainly&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
my unalterable conviction is, that every faithful wife
who aspires to be housekeeper too, becomes the servant
of her servants. They rule not only her but all her
thoughts. Her life circles round them. She can talk of
nothing else. Whether she visits, or is visited, servants
are the staple of her conversation. Their curious habits
and customs, their love-affairs, their laches, their impertinences,
these gradually become the whole food of thought,
ousting every higher aim and idea. I have watched a girl&mdash;my
bosom-friend at Girton&mdash;deteriorate from a maiden
to a wife, from a wife to a bondswoman. First she talked
Shelley, then Charley, then Mary Ann. Gradually her
soul shrank. She lost her character. She became a mere
parasite on the servant&#39;s kitchen, a slave to the cook&#39;s
drink and the housemaid&#39;s followers. Those who knew
my mother before she was married speak of her as a
bright, bonny girl, all enthusiasm and energy, interesting
herself in all the life of her day and even taking a side in
politics. But when I knew her, she was haggard and narrow.
She never read, nor sang, nor played, nor went to
the Academy. The greatest historical occurrences left her
sympathies untouched. She did not even care whether Australia
or England conquered at cricket, or whether Browning
lived or died. You could not get her to discuss Whistler
or the relations of Greek drama to Gaiety Burlesque,
or any other subject that interests ordinary human beings.
She did not want a vote. She did not want any alteration
in the divorce laws. She did not want Russia to be a free
country or the Empire to be federated. She did not want
darkest England to be supplied with lamps. She did not
want the working classes to lead better and nobler lives.
She did not want to preserve the Commons or to abolish
the House of Lords. She did not want to do good or
even to be happy. All she wanted was a cook or a housemaid
or a coachman, as the case might be, and she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
perpetually asking all her acquaintance if they knew of a
good one, or had heard of the outrageous behavior of
the last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In her early married days, my father&#39;s income was not
a twentieth of what it is to-day, and so she was fairly
happy, with only one servant to tyrannize over her. But
she always had hard mistresses, even in those comparatively
easy years. Poor mother! One scene remains
vividly stamped upon my mind. We had a girl named
Selina who would not get up in the morning. We had
nothing to complain of in the time of her going to bed&mdash;I
think she went about nine&mdash;but the earliest she ever rose
was eight, and my father always had to catch the eight-twenty
train to the City, so you may imagine how much
breakfast he got. My mother spoke to Selina about it
nearly every day and Selina admitted the indictment. She
said she could not help it, she seemed to dream such long
dreams and never wake up in the middle. My mother
had had such difficulty in getting Selina that she hesitated
to send her away and start hunting for a new Selina, but the
case seemed hopeless. The winter came on and we took
to sending Selina to bed at six o&#39;clock, that my father
might be sure of a hot cup of coffee before leaving home
in the morning. But she said the mornings were so cold
and dark it was impossible to get out of bed, though she
tried very hard and did her best. I think she spent only
nine hours out of bed on the average. My father gave up
the hope of breakfast. He used to leave by an earlier
train and get something at a restaurant. This grieved my
mother very much&mdash;she calculated it cost her a bonnet a
month. She became determined to convert Selina from
the error of her ways. She told me she was going to appeal
to Selina&#39;s higher nature. Reprimand had failed, but
the soul that cannot be coerced can be touched. That
was in the days when my mother still read poetry and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
semi-independent. One bleak bitter dawn my mother rose
shivering, dressed herself and went down into the kitchen,
to the entire disconcertion of the chronology of the black-beetles.
She made the fire and put the kettle on to boil
and swept the kitchen. She also swept the breakfast-room
and lighted the fire and laid the breakfast. Then she sat
down, put on a saintly expression and waited for Selina.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An hour went by, but Selina did not make her appearance.
The first half-hour passed quickly because my
mother was busy thinking out the exact phrases in which
to touch her higher nature. It required tact&mdash;a single
clumsy turn of language&mdash;and she might offend Selina
instead of elevating her. It was really quite a literary
effort, the adequate expression of my mother&#39;s conception
of the dignity and pathos of the situation, in fact it was
that most difficult branch of literature, the dramatic, for
my mother constructed the entire dialogue, speaking for
Selina as well as for herself. Like all leading ladies,
especially when they write their own plays, my mother
allotted herself the &#39;tag,&#39; and the last words of the
dialogue were:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;There! there! my good girl! Dry your eyes. The
past shall be forgotten. From to-morrow a new life shall
begin. Come, Selina! drink that nice hot cup of tea&mdash;don&#39;t
cry and let it get cold. That&#39;s right.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The second half-hour was rather slower, my mother
listening eagerly for Selina&#39;s footsteps, and pricking up
her ears at every sound. The mice ran about the wainscoting,
the kettle sang blithely, the little flames leaped in
the grate, the kitchen and the breakfast-room were cheerful
and cosy and redolent of the goodly savors of breakfast.
A pile of hot toast lay upon a plate. Only Selina
was wanting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All at once my mother heard the hall-door bang, and
running to the window she saw a figure going out into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
gray freezing fog. It was my father hurrying to catch
his train. In the excitement of the experiment my
mother had forgotten to tell him that for this morning at
least, breakfast could be had at home. He might have
had such beautiful tea and coffee, such lovely toast, such
exquisite eggs, and there he was hastening along in the
raw air on an empty stomach. My mother rapped on the
panes with her knuckles but my father was late and did
not hear. Her own soul a little ruffled, my mother sat
down again in the kitchen and waited for Selina. Gradually
she forgot her chagrin, after all it was the last time
my father would ever have to depart breakfastless. She
went over the dialogue again, polishing it up and adding
little touches.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it was past nine when Selina left her bedroom,
unwashed and rubbing her eyes. By that time my mother
had thrice resisted the temptation to go up and shake her,
and it was coming on a fourth time when she heard
Selina&#39;s massive footstep on the stair. Instantly my
mother&#39;s irritation ceased. She reassumed her look
of sublime martyrdom. She had spread a nice white
cloth on the kitchen table and Selina&#39;s breakfast stood
appetizingly upon it. Tears came into her eyes as she
thought of how Selina would be shaken to her depths by
the sight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Selina threw open the kitchen door with a peevish
push, for she disliked having to get up early in these cold,
dark winter mornings and vented her irritation even upon
insensitive woodwork. But when she saw the deep red
glow of the fire, instead of the dusky chillness of the
normal morning kitchen, she uttered a cry of joy, and
rushing forwards warmed her hands eagerly at the flame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oh, thank you, missus,&#39; she said with genuine gratitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Selina did not seem at all surprised. But my mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
did. She became confused and nervous. She forgot her
words, as if from an attack of stage-fright. There was
no prompter and so for a moment my mother remained
speechless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Selina, having warmed her hands sufficiently, drew her
chair to the table and lifted the cosy from the tea-pot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Why, you&#39;ve let it get cold,&#39; she said reproachfully,
feeling the side of the pot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This was more than my mother could stand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;It&#39;s you that have let it get cold,&#39; she cried hotly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now this was pure impromptu &#39;gag,&#39; and my mother
would have done better to confine herself to the rehearsed
dialogue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oh, missus!&#39; cried Selina. &#39;How can you say that?
Why, this is the first moment I&#39;ve come down.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes,&#39; said my mother, gladly seizing the opportunity
of slipping back into the text. &#39;Somebody had to do the
work, Selina. In this world no work can go undone. If
those whose duty it is do not do it, it must fall on the
shoulders of other people. That is why I got up at seven
this morning instead of you and have tidied up the place
and made the master&#39;s breakfast.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;That was real good of you!&#39; exclaimed Selina, with
impulsive admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother began to feel that the elaborate set piece
was going off in a damp sort of way, but she kept up her
courage and her saintly expression and continued,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;It was freezing when I got out of my warm bed, and
before I could get the fire alight here I almost perished
with cold. I shouldn&#39;t be surprised if I have laid the
seeds of consumption.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ah,&#39; said Selina with satisfaction. &#39;Now you see
what I have had to put up with.&#39; She took another
piece of toast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Selina&#39;s failure to give the cues extremely disconcerted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
my mother. Instead of being able to make the high
moral remarks she had intended, she was forced to invent
<i>repartées</i> on the spur of the moment. The ethical quality
of these improvisations was distinctly inferior.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;But you are paid for it, I&#39;m not,&#39; she retorted sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I know. That is why I say it is so good of you,&#39;
replied Selina, with inextinguishable admiration. &#39;But
you&#39;ll reap the benefit of it. Now that I&#39;ve had my breakfast
without any trouble I shall be able to go about my
work a deal better. It&#39;s such a struggle to get up,
I assure you, missus, it tires me out for the day. Might
I have another egg?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother savagely pushed her another egg.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I&#39;m thinking it would be a good plan,&#39; said Selina,
meditatively opening the egg with her fingers, &#39;if you would
get up instead of me every morning. But perhaps that
was what you were thinking of.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oh, you would like me to, would you?&#39; said my
mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I should be very grateful, I should indeed,&#39; said Selina
earnestly. &#39;And I&#39;m sure the work would be better done.
There don&#39;t seem to be a speck of dust anywhere,&#39;&mdash;she
rubbed her dirty thumb admiringly along the dresser&mdash;&#39;and
I&#39;m sure the tea and toast are lots nicer than any
I&#39;ve ever made.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother waved her hand deprecatingly, but Selina
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oh yes, you know they are. You&#39;ve often told me I
was no use at all in the kitchen. I don&#39;t need to be told
of my shortcomings, missus. All you say of me is quite
true. You would be ever so much more satisfied if you
cooked everything yourself. I&#39;m sure you would.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;And what would <i>you</i> do under this beautiful scheme?&#39;
inquired my mother with withering sarcasm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I haven&#39;t thought of that yet,&#39; said Selina simply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
&#39;But no doubt, if I looked around carefully, I should find
something to occupy me. I couldn&#39;t be long out of work,
I feel sure.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that was how mother&#39;s attempt to elevate Selina
by moral means came to be a fiasco. The next time she
tried to elevate her, it was by physical means. My mother
left the suburb, and moved to a London flat very near the
sky. She had given up hopes of improving Selina&#39;s matutinal
habits, and made the breakfast hour later through
my father having now no train to catch, but she thought
she would cure her of followers. Selina&#39;s flirtations were
not confined to our tradespeople and the local constabulary.
She would exchange remarks about the weather
with the most casual pedestrian in trousers. My mother
thought she would remove her from danger by raising her
high above all earthly temptations. We made the tradesmen
send up their goods by lift and the only person she
could flirt with was the old lift attendant. My father
grumbled a good deal in the early days because the lift
was always at the other extreme when he wanted it, but
Selina&#39;s moral welfare came before all other considerations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By and by they began to renovate the exterior of the
adjoining mansion. They put up a scaffolding, which
grew higher and higher as the work advanced, and men
swarmed upon it. At first my mother contemplated them
with equanimity because they were British working-men
and we were nearest heaven. But as the months went by,
they began to get nearer and nearer. There came a time
when Selina&#39;s smile was distinctly visible to the man
engaged on the section of the scaffolding immediately
below. That smile encouraged him. It seemed to say
&#39;Excelsior.&#39; He was a veritable Don Juan, that laborer.
At every flat he flirted with the maid in possession. By
counting the storeys in our mansion you could calculate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
the number of his <i>amours</i>. With every rise he left a love-passage
behind him. He was a typical man&mdash;always looking
higher, and, when he had raised himself to a more
elevated position, spurning yesterday&#39;s love from beneath
his feet. He seemed to mount on broken hearts. And
now he was aspiring to the highest of all&mdash;Selina. Oh it
is cruel! My mother had secluded Selina like a virgin
Princess in an enchanted inaccessible tower and yet here
was the Prince calmly scaling the tower, without any possibility
of interference. Long before he had reached the
top the consumption of Bass in our flat went up by leaps
and bounds. Selina, my mother ultimately discovered,
used to lower the beer by strings. It appeared, moreover,
that she had two strings to her bow, for a swain in a slouch
hat had been likewise climbing the height, at an insidious
angle which had screened him from my mother&#39;s observation
hitherto. Neither of these men did much work, but
it made them very thirsty.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>Lowering the Beer.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;That destroyed the last vestige of my mother&#39;s faith in
Selina&#39;s soul. Like all disappointed women, she became
crabbed and cynical. When my father&#39;s rising fortunes
brought her more and more under the dominion of servants,
the exposure and out-man&oelig;uvring of her taskmasters
came to be the only pleasure of her life. She spent a
great deal of time in the police-courts&mdash;the constant prosecution
she suffered from, curtailed the last relics of her
leisure. Everybody has heard of the law&#39;s delay, but few
know how much time prosecutors have to lose, hanging
about the Court waiting for their case to be called. When
a servant robbed her, my mother rarely got off with less
than seven days. The moment she had engaged a servant,
she became morbidly suspicious of him or her.
Often, when she had dressed for dinner, it would suddenly
strike her that if she ransacked a certain cupboard something
or other would be discovered, and off she would go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
to spoil her spotless silks. She had a mania for &#39;Spring
cleanings&#39; once a month, so as to keep the drones busy.
Often I would bring a friend home, only to find the dining-room
in the hall and the drawing-room on the landing.
And yet to the end she retained a certain guileless, girlish
simplicity&mdash;a fresh fund of hope which was not without a
charm and pathos of its own. To the very last she believed
that, faultless, flawless servants existed somewhere
and she didn&#39;t intend to be happy till she got them; so
that it was said of her by my sister&#39;s intended that she
passed her life on the doorstep, either receiving an angel
or expelling a fiend. It showed what a fine trustful nature
had been turned to gall. She is at rest now, poor mother,
her life&#39;s long slavery ended by the soft touch of all-merciful
Death. Let us hope that she has opened her sorrow-stricken
eyes on a brighter land, where earthly distinctions
are annulled and the poor heavy-laden mistress may mix
on equal terms with the radiant parlor-maid and the
buxom cook.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The tears were in Lillie&#39;s eyes as Miss Eustasia Pallas
concluded her affecting recital.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But don&#39;t you think,&quot; said the President, conquering
her emotion, &quot;that with such an awful example in your
memory, you could never yourself sink into such a serfage,
even if you married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare not trust myself,&quot; said Eustasia. &quot;I have seen
the fall of too many other women. Why should I expect
immunity from the general fate? I think myself strong&mdash;but
who can fathom her own weakness. Why, I have
actually been talking servants to you all the time. Think
how continuous is the temptation, how subtle. Were it
not better to possess my soul in peace and to cultivate it
nobly and wisely and become a shining light of the higher
spinsterhood?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Eustasia passed the preliminary examination and also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
the viva voce, and Lillie was again in high feather. But
before the election was formally confirmed, she was chagrined
to receive the following letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Dulcimer.</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have good news for you. Knowing your anxiety to
find for me a way out of my matrimonial dilemma, I am
pleased to be able to inform you that it has been found by
my friend and literary adviser, Percy Swinshel Spatt, the
well known philosopher and idealist. I met him writing
down his thoughts in Bond Street. In the course of a
dialogue upon the Beautiful, I put my puzzle to him and he
solved it in a moment. &#39;Why <i>must</i> you keep a servant?&#39; he
asked, for it is his habit to question every statement he
does not make. &#39;Why not rather keep a mistress? Become
a servant yourself and all your difficulties vanish.&#39;
It was like a flash of lightning. &#39;Yes,&#39; I said, when I had
recovered from the dazzle, &#39;but that would mean separation
from my husband.&#39; &#39;Why?&#39; he replied with his usual
habit. &#39;In many houses they prefer to take married couples.&#39;
&#39;Ah, but where should I find a man of like mind, a
man to whom leisure for the cultivation of his soul was
the one great necessity of life?&#39; &#39;It is a curious coincidence,
Eustasia,&#39; he replied, &#39;that I was just myself contemplating
keeping a master and retiring into a hermitage
below stairs, to devote myself to philosophical contemplation.
As a butler or a footman in a really aristocratic
establishment, my duties would be nominal, and the other
servants and my employers would attend to all my wants.
Abstract speculation would naturally indue me with the
grave silence and dignity which seem to be the chief duties
of these superior creatures. It is possible, Eustasia, that
I am not the first to perceive the advantages of this way
of living and that plush is but the disguise of the philosopher.
As for you, Eustasia, you could become a parlor-maid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
Thus we should live together peacefully, with no
sordid housekeeping cares, no squalid interests in rates or
taxes, devoted heart and soul to the higher life.&#39; &#39;You
light up for me perspectives of Paradise,&#39; I cried enthusiastically.
&#39;Then let us get the key of the garden at once,&#39;
he replied rapturously, and turning over a new leaf of his
philosophical note-book, he set to work then and there to
draw up the advertisement: &#39;Wanted&mdash;by a young married
couple, etc.&#39; Of course we had to be a little previous,
because I could not consent to marry him unless we had
a situation to go to. We were only putting what the Greek
grammars call a proleptic construction upon the situation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
Well, it seems good servants are so scarce we got a place
at once&mdash;the exact thing we were looking for. We are
concealing our real names (lest the profession be overrun
by jealous friends from Newnham and Girton and Oxford
and Cambridge) so that I was able to give Percy a character
and Percy to give me a character. We are going into our
place next Monday afternoon, so, to avoid obtaining the
situation by false pretences, we shall have to go before
the Registrar on the Monday morning. Our honeymoon
will be spent in the delightful and unexploited retreat of
the back kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is, indeed, a happy solution,&quot; said Lord Silverdale
enviously. &quot;To spend your life in the service of other
men, yet to save it for yourself! It reconciles all ideals.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you can very easily try it,&quot; said Lillie. &quot;I
have just heard from the Princess of Portman Square&mdash;she
is reorganizing her household in view of her nuptials.
Shall I write you a recommendation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but I will read you an Address to an Egyptian
Tipcat,&quot; replied his lordship, with the irrelevancy which
was growing upon him. &quot;You know the recent excavations
have shown that the little Egyptians used to play
&#39;pussy-cat&#39; five thousand years ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">ADDRESS TO AN EGYPTIAN TIP-CAT.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou Sphynx in wood, unchanged, serene, immortal,</span><br />

<span class="i0">And art thou&mdash;here&#39;s my last, if not my stiffest&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">As good a bouncer as the hieroglyphist?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, did the hieroglyphists use to brag?&quot; asked
Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shamefully. You can no more believe in their statements
than in epitaphs. There seems something peculiarly
mendacious about stone as a recording medium. Only
it must be admitted on behalf of the hieroglyphists that
it may be the Egyptologists who are the braggers. There
never was an ancient inscription which is not capable of
being taken in a dozen different ways, like a party-leader&#39;s
speech. Every word has six possible meanings and half
a dozen probable ones. The <i>savants</i> only pretend to understand
the stones.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So saying Lord Silverdale took his departure. On the
doorstep he met a young lady carrying a brown paper
parcel. She smiled so sweetly at him that he raised his
hat and wondered where he had met her.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was only another candidate. She faced Turple
the magnificent and smiled on, unawed. Turple ended
by relaxing his muscles a whit, then ashamed of himself
he announced gruffly, &quot;Miss Mary Friscoe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After the preliminary formalities, and after having
duly assured herself that there was no male ear within
earshot, Miss Friscoe delivered herself of the following
candid confession.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am a pretty girl, as you can see. I wear sweet frocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
and smiles, and my eyes are of Heaven&#39;s own blue. Men
are fond of gazing into them. Men are so artistic. They
admire the beautiful and tell her so. Women are so different.
I have overheard my girl friends call me &#39;that
silly little flirt.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hold that any woman can twist any man round her
little finger or his arm round her waist, therefore I consider
it no conceit to say I have attracted considerable
attention. If I had accepted all the offers I received,
my marriages could easily have filled a column of <i>The
Times</i>. I know there are women who think that men are
coarse, unsentimental creatures, given over to slang, tobacco,
billiards, betting, brandies and sodas, smoking-room
stories, flirtations with barmaids, dress and general depravity.
But the women who say or write that are soured
creatures, who have never been loved, have never fathomed
the depth and purity of men&#39;s souls.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been loved. I have been loved much and often,
and I speak as one who knows. Man is the most maligned
animal in creation. He is the least gross and carnal of
creatures, the most exquisitely pure and refined in thought
and deed; the most capable of disinterested devotion,
self-sacrifice, chivalry, tenderness. Every man is his own
Bayard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If men had their deserts we women&mdash;heartless, frivolous,
venal creatures that we are&mdash;would go down on our knees
to them, and beg them to marry us. I am a woman and
again I speak as one who knows. For I am not a bad
specimen of my sex. Even my best friends admit I am
only silly. I am really a very generous and kind-hearted
little thing. I never keep my tailor waiting longer than a
year, I have made quite a number of penwipers for the
poor, and I have never told an unnecessary lie in my life.
I give a great deal of affection to my mother and even a
little assistance in the household. I do not smoke scented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
cigarettes. I read travels and biographies as well as novels,
play the guitar rather well, attend a Drawing Class, rise
long before noon, am good-tempered, wear my ball-dresses
more than once, turn winter dresses into spring frocks by
stripping off the fur and putting on galon, and diversify my
gowns by changing the sleeves. In short, I am a superior,
thoroughly domesticated girl. And yet I have never met
a man who has not had the advantage of me in all the
virtues.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was George Holly,&mdash;I regret I cannot mention
my lovers in chronological order, but my memories are so
vague, they all seem to fuse into one another. Perhaps
it is because there is a lack of distinctiveness about men&mdash;a
monotonous goodness which has its charm but is extremely
confusing. One thing I do remember though,
about George&mdash;at least, I think it was George. His moustache
was rather bristly, and the little curled tips used to
tickle one&#39;s nose comically. I was very disappointed in
George, I had heard such a lot of talk about him; but
when I got to really know him I found he was not a bit
like it. How I came to really know him was like this.
&#39;Mary,&#39; he said, as we sat on the stairs, high up, so as
not to be in the way of the waiters. &#39;Won&#39;t you say
&quot;yes&quot; and make me the happiest man alive? Never man
loved as I love now. Answer me. Do not torture me
with suspense.&#39; I was silent; speechless with happiness
to think that I had won this true manly heart. I looked
down at my fan. My lips were forming the affirmative
monosyllable, when George continued passionately,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ah, Mary, speak! Mary, the only woman I ever
loved.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I turned pale with emotion. Tears came into my eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Is this true?&#39; I articulated. &#39;Am I really the only
woman you ever loved?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;By my hopes of a hereafter, yes!&#39; George was a bit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
slangy in his general conversation. The shallow world
never knew the poetry he could rise to. &#39;This is the
first time I have known what it is to love, Mary, my sweet,
my own.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;No, not your own,&#39; I interrupted coldly, for my heart
was like ice within me. &#39;I belong to myself, and I intend
to. Will you give me your arm into the ballroom&mdash;Mr.
Daythorpe must be looking for me everywhere.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It sounds very wicked to say it, I know, but I cannot
delay my confession longer. I love, I adore, I doat on
wicked men, men who love not wisely but too well. When
I learnt history at school I could always answer questions
about the reign of Charles II., it was such a deliciously
wicked period. I love Burns, Lord Byron, De Musset,
Lovelace&mdash;all the nice naughty men of history or fiction.
I like Ouida&#39;s guardsman, whose love is a tornado, and
Charlotte Bronte&#39;s Rochester, and Byron&#39;s Don Juan. I
hate, I detest milksops. And a good man always seems
to me a milksop. It is a flaw&mdash;a terrible flaw in my composition,
I know&mdash;but I cannot help it. It makes me
miserable, but what can I do? Nature will out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was how I came to find George out, to discover he
was not the terrible cavalier, the abandoned squire of
dames the world said he was. His reputation was purely
bogus. The gossips might buzz, but I had it on the highest
authority. I was the first woman he had ever loved.
What pleasure is there in such a conquest? It grieved
me to break his heart, but I had no option.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Daythorpe was another fellow who taught me the same
lesson of the purity and high emotions of his cruelly
libelled sex. He, too, when driven into a corner (far from
the madding crowd) confessed that I was the only woman
he had ever loved. I have tried them all&mdash;poets and
musicians, barristers and business-men. They all had suffered
from the same incapacity for affection till they met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
me. It was quite pathetic to discover how truly all men
were brothers. The only difference was that while some
added I was the only woman they ever could love, others
insisted that never man had loved before as they did now.
The latter lovers always remind me of advertisers offering
a superior article to anything in the trade. Nowhere could
I meet the man I longed for&mdash;the man who had lived and
loved. Once I felt stirrings towards a handsome young
widower, but he went out of his way to assure me he had
never cared for his first wife. After that, of course, he had
no chance.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Platonic Love.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unable to discover any but good young men, I resigned
myself perforce to spinsterhood. I resolved to cultivate
only Platonic relations. I told young men to come to me
and tell me their troubles. I encouraged them to sit at
my feet and confide in me while I held their hands to give
them courage. But even so they would never confess anything
worth hearing, and if they did love anybody it invariably
turned out to be me and me only. Yes, I grieve to
say these Platonic young men were just as good as the
others; leaving out the audacity of their proposing to me
when I had given them no encouragement. Here again
I found men distressingly alike. They are constitutionally
unable to be girls&#39; chums, they are always hankering
to convert the friendship into love. Time after time anticipations
of a genuine comradeship were rudely dispelled
by fatuous philandering. Yet I never ceased to be surprised,
and I never lost hope. Such, I suppose, is the
simple trustfulness of a girl&#39;s nature. In time I got to
know when the explosion was coming, and this deadened
the shock. I found it was usually preceded by suicidal
remarks of a retrospective character. My comrades would
tell me of their past lives, of the days when the world&#39;s
oyster was yet unopened by them. In those dark days
(tears of self-pity came into their eyes as they spoke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
them) they were on the point of suicide&mdash;to a man. Only,
one little thing always came to save them&mdash;their first brief,
the acceptance of their first article, poem or song, the
opportune deaths of aunts, the chance hearing of an
organ-note rolling through the portal of a village church
on a Sunday afternoon, a letter from an old schoolmaster.
The obvious survival of the narrators rather spoiled the
sensational thrill for me, but they themselves were always
keenly touched by the story. And from suicide in the
past to suicide in the future was an easy transition. Alas,
I was the connecting link. They loved me&mdash;and unless
I returned their love, that early suicide would prove to
have been merely postponed. In the course of conversation
it transpired that I was the first woman they had ever
loved. I remember once rejecting on this account two
such Platonic failures, within ten minutes of each other.
One was a well-known caricaturist, and the other was the
editor of a lady&#39;s paper.
Each left me, declaring
his heart was broken,
that I had led him on
shamelessly, that I was
a heartless jilt and that
he would go and kill
himself. My brother
Tom accidentally told
me he saw them together
about an hour afterwards
at a bar in the
Strand, asking each
other what was their
poison.  So I learnt
that they had spoken
the truth. I had driven them to drink. And according
to Tom the drink at this particular bar is superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
to strychnine.  He says men always take it in
preference.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And have you then finally decided to abandon Platonics?&quot;
asked Lillie, when the flow of words came to an
end.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Finally.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you have decided to enroll in our ranks?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mary Friscoe hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well about that part I&#39;m not quite so certain. To
tell the truth, there is one young man of my acquaintance
who has never yet proposed. When I started for here in
disgust at the goodness of mankind I forgot him, but in
talking he has come back to my mind. I have a strong
suspicion he is quite wicked. He is always painting
actresses. Don&#39;t you think it would be unfair to him to
take my vows without giving him a chance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes,&quot; said Lillie musingly, &quot;perhaps it would.
You would feel easier afterwards. Otherwise you might
always reproach yourself with the thought that you had
perhaps turned away from a bad man&#39;s love. You might
feel that the world was not so good as you had imagined
in your girlish cynicism, and then you might regret having
joined us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so,&quot; said Miss Friscoe eagerly. &quot;But he shall
be the very last man I will listen to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When do you propose to be proposed to by him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The sooner the better. This very day, if you like. I
am going straight from here to my Drawing Class.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. Then you will come to-morrow and tell
me your final decision?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Miss Mary Friscoe arrived at the Drawing Class late.
Her fellow students of both sexes were already at their
easels and her entry distracted everybody. It was a motley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
gathering, working in motley media&mdash;charcoal, chalk,
pencil, oil, water-color. One girl was modelling in clay,
and one young gentleman, opera-glass in hand, was making
enlarged colored copies of photographs. It was this young
gentleman that Mary came out for to see. His name was
Bertie Smythe. He was rich, but he would always be a
poor artist. His ambition was to paint the nude.</p>

<p class="indent">There were lilies of the valley in the bosom of Mary&#39;s
art-gown, and when she arrived she unfolded the brown
paper parcel she carried and took therefrom a cardboard
box containing a snow-white collar and spotless cuffs,
which she proceeded to adjust upon her person. She
then went to the drawing-board rack and stood helpless,
unable to reach down her board, which was quite two
inches above her head. There was a rush of embryo
R.A.&#39;S. Those who failed to hand her the board got down
the cast and dusted it for her and fixed it up according to
her minute and detailed directions, and adjusted her easel,
and brought her a trestle, and lent her lead-pencils, and
cut them for her, and gave her chunks of stale bread, for
all which services she rewarded them with bewitching
smiles and profuse thanks and a thousand apologies. It
took her a long time getting to work on the charcoal
cluster of plums which had occupied her ever since the
commencement of the term, because she never ventured
to commence without holding long confabulations with
her fellow-students as to whether the light was falling in
exactly the same way as last time. She got them to cock
their heads on one side and survey the sketch, to retreat
and look at it knowingly, to measure the visual angle with
a stick of charcoal, or even to manipulate delicately the
great work itself. Meantime she fluttered about it,
chattering, alternately enraptured and dissatisfied, and
when at last she started, it was by rubbing everything out.</p>

<p class="indent">The best position for drawing happened to be next to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
Bertie Smythe.  That artist was now engaged in copying
the portrait of an actress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mr. Smythe,&quot; said Mary suddenly, in a confidential
whisper. &quot;I&#39;ve got such a beautiful face for you
to paint.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know you have!&quot; flashed Bertie, in the same intimate
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a tease you are, twisting my words like that,&quot;
said Mary, rapping him playfully on the knuckles with her
mahl-stick. &quot;You know what I mean quite well. It&#39;s a
cousin of mine in the country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see&mdash;it runs in the family,&quot; said Bertie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What runs in the family?&quot; asked Mary.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beautiful faces, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that&#39;s too bad of you,&quot; said Mary pouting. &quot;You
know I don&#39;t like compliments.&quot; She rubbed a pellet of
bread fretfully into her drawing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t pay compliments. I tell the truth,&quot; said Bertie,
meeting her gaze unflinchingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, look at that funny little curl Miss Roberts is
wearing to-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bother Miss Roberts. When are you going to let me
have <i>your</i> face to paint?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My cousin&#39;s, you mean,&quot; said Mary, rubbing away
harder than ever.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don&#39;t. I mean yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never give away photographs to gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sit to me then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit to you! Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In my studio.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good gracious! What are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you are too tiresome. I shall never get this
finished,&quot; grumbled Mary, concentrating herself so vigorously
on the drawing that she absent-mindedly erased the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
last vestiges of it. She took up her plumb-line and held
it in front of her cast and became absorbed in contemplating
it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven&#39;t answered my question, Miss Friscoe,&quot;
whispered Bertie pertinaciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What question?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When are you going to lend me your face?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look, there&#39;s Mr. Biskett going home already!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang Mr. Biskett! I say, Mary&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he began passionately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you getting on, Mr. Smythe?&quot; came the
creaking voice of Potts, the drawing-master, behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pretty well, thank you; how&#39;s yourself?&quot; mechanically
replied Bertie, greatly flustered by his inopportune
arrival.</p>

<p class="indent">Potts stared and Mary burst into a ringing laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look at <i>my</i> drawing, Mr. Potts,&quot; she said. &quot;It <i>will</i>
come so funny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, there&#39;s nothing there,&quot; said Potts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me, no more there is,&quot; said Mary. &quot;I&mdash;I was
entirely dissatisfied with it. You might just sketch it in
for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Potts was accustomed to doing the work of most of the
lady students. They used to let him do a little bit on
each of his rounds till the thing was completed. He set
to work on Mary&#39;s drawing, leaving her to finish being
proposed to.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you really love me?&quot; Mary was saying, while
Potts was sketching the second plum.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you doubt it?&quot; Bertie whispered tremulously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do doubt it. You have loved so many girls,
you know. Oh, I have heard all about your conquests.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thought it was best to take the bull by the horns,
and her breath came thick and fast as she waited for the
reply that would make or mar her life.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
Bertie&#39;s face lit up with pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he began.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes, I know,&quot; she interrupted triumphantly.
&quot;What about that actress you are painting now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well,&quot; said Bertie. &quot;If you say &#39;yes,&#39; I promise
never to speak to her again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you will give up your bad habits?&quot; she continued
joyfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Every one. Even my cigarettes, if you say the word.
My whole life shall be devoted to making you happy.
You shall never hear a cross word from my lips.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mary&#39;s face fell, her lip twitched. What was the use
of marrying a milksop like that? Where would be the
fun of a union without mutual recriminations and sweet
reconciliations? She even began to doubt whether he
was wicked after all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you ever really love that actress?&quot; she whispered
anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, of course I didn&#39;t,&quot; said Bertie soothingly. &quot;To
tell the truth, I have never spoken to her in my life. I
bought her photo in the Burlington arcade and I only
talk with the fellows about ballet girls in order, not to be
behind the times. I never knew what love was till I met
you. You are the only&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Crash! bang! went his three-legged easel, upset by
Mary&#39;s irrepressible movement of pique. The eyes of
the class were on them in a moment, but only Mary knew
that in that crash her last hope of happiness had fallen,
too.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;I do trust Miss Friscoe&#39;s last chance will not prove a
blank again,&quot; said Lord Silverdale, when Lillie had told
him of the poor girl&#39;s disappointments.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked the President.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I shrink from the <i>viva voce</i> examination.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
&quot;Why?&quot; asked the President.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid I should be so dangerous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked the President.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because <i>I have</i> loved before. I shall be desperately
in love with another woman all through the interview.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I am so sorry, but you are inadmissible,&quot; said
Lillie, when Miss Friscoe came to announce her willingness
to join the Club.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked the candidate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you belong to an art-class. It is forbidden
by our by-laws. How stupid of me not to think of it yesterday!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am ready to give it up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I couldn&#39;t dream of allowing that on any account,&quot;
said the President. &quot;I hear you draw so well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Mary never went before the Honorary Trier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, by the way, Miss Friscoe will not trouble you, you

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed?&quot; said Silverdale. &quot;Then she has drawn a
prize after all! I cannot say as much for the young
man. I hardly think she is a credit to your sex. Somehow,
she reminded me of a woman I used to know, and
of some verses I wrote upon her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">(&quot;If he had given me a chance, and not gone on to
read his poetry so quickly,&quot; wrote Lillie in her diary that
night, &quot;I might have told him that his inference about

not worth telling him now, especially as he practically
intimated she would have been an undesirable member,

<p class="indent">I, Anton Mendoza, bachelor, born thirty years ago by
the grace of the Holy Virgin, on the <i>fête</i>-day of San Anton,
patron of pigs and old maids, after sundry adventures
by sea and land, found myself in the autumn of
last year in the pestiferous atmosphere of London. I
had picked up bad English and a good sum of money in
South America, and by the aid of the two was enabled to
thread my way through the mazes of the metropolis. I
soon tired of the neighborhood of the Alhambra (in the
proximity of which I had with mistaken patriotism established
myself), for the wealthy quarters of all great cities
have more affinities than differences, and after a few days
of sight-seeing I resolved to fare forth in quest of the real
sights of London. Mounting the box of the first omnibus
that came along, I threw the reins of my fortunes into the
hands of the driver, and drew a little blue ticket from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
lottery of fate. I scanned the slip of paper curiously and
learned therefrom that I was going fast to &quot;The Angel,&quot;
which I shrewdly divined to be a public-house, knowing
that these islanders display no poetry and imagination
save in connection with beer. My intuition was correct,
and though it was the forenoon I alighted amid a double
stream of pedestrians, the one branch flowing into &quot;The
Angel,&quot; and the other issuing therefrom. Extricating
myself, I looked at my compass, and following the direction
of the needle soon found myself in a network of unlovely
streets. For an hour I paced forwards without
chancing on aught of interest, save many weary organ-grinders,
seemingly serenading their mistresses with upward
glances at their chamber-windows, and I was commencing
to fear that my blue ticket would prove a blank, when a
savory odor of garlic struck on my nostrils and apprised
me that my walk had given me an appetite. Glancing
sideways I saw a door swinging, the same bearing in
painted letters on the glass the words: &quot;Menotti&#39;s Restaurant&mdash;Ici
on parle Francais.&quot; It looked a queer little
place, and the little back street into which I had strayed
seemed hardly auspicious of cleanly fare. Still the jewel
of good cookery harbors often in the plainest caskets,
and I set the door swinging again and passed into a narrow
room walled with cracked mirrors and furnished with
a few little tables, a rusty waiter, and a proprietorial looking
person perpetually bent over a speaking tube. As
noon was barely arrived, I was not surprised to find the
place all but empty. At the extreme end of the restaurant
I caught a glimpse of a stout dark man with iron-gray
whiskers. I thought I would go and lunch at the table of
the solitary customer and scrape acquaintance, and thus
perhaps achieve an adventure. But hardly had I seated
myself opposite him than a shock traversed his face, the
morsel he had just swallowed seemed to stick in his throat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
he rose coughing violently, and clapping his palm over his
mouth with the fingers spread out almost as if he wished
to hide his face, turned his back quickly, seized his hat,
threw half-a-crown to the waiter and scuttled from the
establishment.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>He scuttled from the Establishment.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">I was considerably surprised at his abrupt departure, as
if I had brought some infection with me. The momentary
glimpse I had caught of his face had convinced me I had
never seen it before, that it had no place in the photograph
album of my brain, though now it would be fixed
there forever. The nose hooked itself on to my memory
at once. It must be that he had mistaken me for somebody
else, somebody whom he had reason to fear. Perhaps
he was a criminal and imagined me a detective. I
called the proprietor and inquired of him in French who
the man was and what was the matter with him. But he
shook his head and answered: &quot;That man there puzzles
me. There is a mystery behind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, has he done anything strange before to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not precisely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will tell you. He comes here once a year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Once a year?&quot; I repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No more. This has been going on for twelve years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you telling me there?&quot; I murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how have you remembered him from year to
year?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was struck by his face and his air the very first
time. He seemed anxious, ill at ease, worried. He left
his chop half eaten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha!&quot; I murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Also he looks different from most of my clients.
They are not of that type. Of course I forget him immediately&mdash;it
is not my affair. But when he comes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
second time I recall him on the instant, though a year has
passed. Again he looks perturbed, restless. I say to
myself: &#39;Aha, thou art not a happy man, there is something
which preys on thy mind. However, thy money is
good and to the devil with the rest.&#39; So it goes on.
After three or four visits I commence to look out for him,
and I discover that it is only once a year he does me the
honor to arrive. There are twelve years that I know him&mdash;I
have seen him twelve times.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he has always this nervous air?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not always. That varies. Sometimes he appears
calm, sometimes even happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps it is your fare,&quot; I said slily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, no, monsieur, that does not vary. It is always of
the first excellence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does he always come on the same date?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, monsieur. There is the puzzle. It is never exactly
a year between his visits&mdash;sometimes it is more,
sometimes it is less.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is, indeed, the puzzle,&quot; I agreed. &quot;If it were
always the same date, it would be a clue. Ah, an idea!
He comes not always on the same date of the month, but
he comes, perhaps, on the same day of the week, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again the proprietor dashed me back into the depths
of perplexity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; he said, decisively. &quot;Monday, Wednesday,
Saturday,&mdash;it is all the same. The only thing that changes
not is the man and his dress. Always the same broadcloth
frock-coat and the same high hat and the same seals
at the heavy watch-chain. He is a rich man, that sees itself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I wrinkled my brow and tugged the ends of my moustache
in the effort to find a solution. The proprietor
tugged the ends of his own moustache in sympathetic
silence.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
&quot;Does he always slink out if anybody sits down opposite
to him?&quot; I inquired again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the contrary. He talks and chats quite freely
with his neighbors when there are any. I have seen his
countenance light up when a man has come to seat himself
next to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then to-day is the first time he has behaved so
strangely?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Absolutely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again I was silent. I looked at myself curiously in the
cracked mirror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you see anything strange in my appearance?&quot; I
asked the proprietor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing in the world,&quot; said the proprietor, shaking
his head vigorously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing in the world,&quot; echoed the waiter, emphatically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why does he object to me, when he doesn&#39;t object
to anybody else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon,&quot; said the proprietor. &quot;It is, after all, but
rarely that a stranger sits at his table. He comes ordinarily
so early for his lunch that my clients have not yet
arrived, and I have only the honor to serve an accidental
customer like yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, then, there is some regularity about the time of
day at least?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes, there is that,&quot; said the proprietor, reflectively.
&quot;But even here there is no hard and fast line. He may
be an hour earlier, he may be an hour later.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a droll of a man!&quot; I said laughing, even as I
wondered. &quot;And you have not been able to discover anything
about him, though he has given it you in twelve?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not my affair,&quot; he repeated, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know not his name even?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
&quot;How should I know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, very well, you shall see!&quot; I said, buttoning up
my coat resolutely and rising to my feet. &quot;You shall see
that I will find out everything in once. I, a stranger in
London, who love the oceans and the forests better than
the cities, I, who know only the secrets of Nature, behold,
I will solve you this mystery of humanity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As monsieur pleases,&quot; replied the proprietor. &quot;For
me the only question is what monsieur will have for his
lunch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want no lunch,&quot; I cried. Then seeing his downcast
face and remembering the man must be out of sight by
this time and nothing was to be gained by haste, I ordered
some broth and a veal and ham pie, and strode to the door
to make sure there was no immediate chance of coming
upon him. The little by-street was almost deserted, there
was not a sign of my man. I returned to my seat and
devoted myself to my inner man instead. Then I rebuttoned
my coat afresh&mdash;though with less facility&mdash;and sauntered
out joyously. Now at last I had found something
to interest me in London. The confidence born of a good
meal was strong in my bosom as I pushed those swinging
doors open and cried &quot;<i>Au revoir</i>,&quot; to my host, for I
designed to return and to dazzle him with my exploits.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Au revoir</i>, monsieur, a thousand thanks,&quot; cried the
proprietor, popping up from his speaking-tube. &quot;But
where are you going? Where do you hope to find this
man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I go not to find the man,&quot; I replied airily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Comment!</i>&quot; he exclaimed in his astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I go to seek the woman,&quot; I said in imposing accents.
And waving my hand amicably I sallied forth into the
dingy little street.</p>

<p class="indent">But alas for human anticipations! The whole of that
day I paced the dead and alive streets of North London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
without striking the faintest indication of a trail. After a
week&#39;s futile wanderings I began to realize the immensity
of the English metropolis&mdash;immense not only by its actual
area, but by the multiplicity of its streets and windings,
and by the indifference of each household to its neighbors,
which makes every roof the cover of manifold mysterious
existences and potentialities. To look for a needle in a
bundle of hay were child&#39;s play to the task of finding a face
in a London suburb, even assuming as I did my enigma
lived in the northern district. I dared not return to the
restaurant to inquire if perchance he had been seen. I
was ashamed to confess myself baffled. I shifted my
quarters from Leicester Square to Green Lanes and walked
every day within a four mile radius of the restaurant, but
fortune turned her face (and his) from me and I raged at
my own folly in undertaking so futile a quest. At last,
&quot;Patience!&quot; I cried. &quot;Patience, and shuffle the cards!&quot;
It was my pet proverb when off the track of anything. To
cut yourself adrift from the old plan and look at the problem
with new eyes&mdash;that was my recipe. I tried it by
going into the country for some stag hunting, which I had
ascertained from a farmer whom I met in a coffee-house,
could be obtained in some of the villages in the next county.
But English field-sports I found little to my taste, for the
deer had been unhorned and was let out of a cart, and it
was only playing at sport. The Holy Mother save me
from such bloodless make-believe! Though the hunting
season was in full swing I returned in disgust to the town,
and again confiding my fortunes to a common or garden
omnibus, I surveyed the street panorama from my seat on
the roof till the vehicle turned round for the backward
journey. This time I found myself in Canonbury, a district
within the radius I had previously explored. The
coincidence gave me fresh hope&mdash;it seemed a happy augury
of ultimate success. The saints would guide my footsteps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
after all; for he who wills aught intensely cajoles
Providence. The dusk had fallen and the night lamps
had been lit in the heavens and on the earth, though without
imparting cheerfulness to the rigid rows of highly respectable
houses. I walked through street after street
of gray barracks, tall narrow structures holding themselves
with the military stiffness and ranged in serried columns,
the very greenery that relieved their fronts growing sympathetically
symmetrical and sombre. I sighed for my
native orange-groves, I longed for a whiff of the blue
Mediterranean, I strove to recall the breezy expanses of the
South American Pampas whence I had come, and had it
not been for the interest of my search, I should have fled
like St. Anthony from the lady, though for very opposite
reasons. It seemed scarcely possible that romance should
brood behind those dull façades; the grosser spirit of prose
seemed to shroud them as in a fog.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, as I paced with clogged footsteps in these
heavy regions, I heard a voice calling somebody, and looking
in the direction of the sound I could not but fancy it
was myself whose attention was sought. A gentleman
standing at the hall-door of one of the houses, at the top
of the white steps, was beckoning in my direction. I
halted, and gazing on all sides ascertained I was the sole
pedestrian. Puzzled as to what he could want of me, I
tried to scan his features by the rays of a street lamp which
faced the house and under which I stood. They revealed
a pleasant but not English-looking face, bearded and
bronzed, but they revealed nothing as to the owner&#39;s designs.
He stood there still beckoning, and the latent
hypnotism of the appeal drew me towards the gate. I
paused with my hand on the lock. What in the name of
all the saints could he possibly want with me? I had
sundry valuables about my person, but then they included
a loaded revolver, so why refuse the adventure?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
&quot;Do come in,&quot; he said in English, seeing my hesitation.
&quot;<i>We are only waiting for you.</i>&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 416px;">
<img src="images/i173.jpg" width="416" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>I accepted the strange invitation.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The mysterious language of the invitation sealed my fate.
Evidently I had again been mistaken for somebody else.
Was it that I resembled someone this man knew? If so,
it would probably be the same someone the other man had
dreaded. I seemed to feel the end of a clew at last, the
other end which was tied to him I sought. Putting my
hand to my breast pocket to make sure it held my pistol, I
drew back the handle of the gate and ascended the steps.
There was an expression of satisfaction on the face of my
inviter, and, turning his back upon me he threw the door
wide open and held it courteously as I entered. A whiff
of warm stuffy air smote my nostrils as I stepped into the
hall where an india-rubber plant stood upon a rack heavily
laden with overcoats. My host preceded me a few paces
and opened a door on the right. A confused babble of
guttural speech broke upon my ear, and over his shoulder
I caught a glimpse of a strange scene&mdash;a medley of swarthy
men, wearing their hats, a venerable-looking old man who
seemed their chief being prominent in a grim, black
skull cap; there was a strange weird wick burning in a
cup of oil on the mantelpiece, and on a sofa at the extreme
end of the room sat a beautiful young lady weeping silently.</p>

<p class="indent">My heart gave a great leap. Instinct told me I had
found the woman. I made the sign of the cross and
entered.</p>

<p class="indent">A strange look of relief passed over the faces of the
company as I entered. Instinctively I removed my hat,
but he who had summoned me deprecated the courtesy
with a gesture, remarking, &quot;We are commencing at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I stared at him, more puzzled than ever, but kept silence
lest speech should betray me and snatch the solution from
me on the very eve of my arrival at it.</p>

<p class="indent">It was gathering in my mind that I must strikingly resemble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
one of the band, that the man of the restaurant had
betrayed us, and that he went in fear of our vengeance.
Only thus could I account for my reception both by him
and by the rest of the gang.</p>

<p class="indent">The patriarchal-looking chieftain got up and turned his
back to the company, as if surveying them through the
mirror. He then addressed them at great length with
averted face in a strange language, the others following
him attentively and accompanying his remarks with an
undercurrent of murmured sympathy, occasionally breaking
out into loud exclamations of assent in the same tongue.
I listened with all my ears, but could not form the least
idea as to what the language was. There were gutturals
in it as in German, but I can always detect German if I
cannot understand it. There was never a word which had
the faintest analogy with any of the European tongues. I
came to the conclusion it was a patter of their own. The
leader spoke hurriedly for the most part, but in his slower
passages there was a rise and fall of the voice almost
amounting to a musical inflection. Near the end, after
an emphatic speech frequently interrupted by applause,
he dropped his voice to a whisper and a hushed silence
fell upon the room. The beautiful girl on the couch got
up and, holding a richly-bound book in her hand, perused
it quietly. Her lovely eyes were heavy with tears. I
drifted upon a current of wonder into perusing her face,
and it was with a start that, at the sudden resumption of
the leader&#39;s speech, I woke from my dreams. The address
came to a final close soon after, and then another member
wound up the proceedings with a little speech, which was
received with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="indent">While he was speaking, I studied the back of the patriarch&#39;s
head. He moved it, and my eyes accidentally
lighted on something on the mantelpiece which sent a thrill
through my whole being. It was a photograph, and unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
some hallucination tricked my vision, the photograph of
the man I sought. I trembled with excitement. My instinct
had been correct. I had found the woman. Saint
Antony had guided my footsteps aright. The company
was slowly dispersing, chatting as it went. Everybody
took leave of the beautiful girl, who had by this time dried
her eyes and resumed the queen. I should have to go
with them, and without an inkling of comprehension of
what had passed! What had they been plotting? What
part had I been playing in these uncanny transactions?
What had they been doing to bring suffering to this fair
girl, before whom all bowed in mock homage? Was she
the unwilling accomplice of their discreditable designs?
I could not see an inch in the bewildering fog. And was
I to depart like the rest, doomed to cudgel my brains till
they ached like caned schoolboys? No, my duty was
clear. A gentle creature was in trouble&mdash;it was my business
to stay and succor her.</p>

<p class="indent">Then suddenly the thought flashed upon me that she
loved the man who had betrayed us, that she had pleaded
with fear for his life, and that her petition had been granted.
The solution seemed almost complete, yet it found me no
more willing to go. Had I not still to discover for what
end we were leagued together?</p>

<p class="indent">As I stood motionless, thus musing, the minutes and
the company slipped away. I was left with the man of
the doorstep, the second speaker, and the beautiful
girl.</p>

<p class="indent">While I was wondering by what pretext to remain, the
second speaker came up to me and said cordially: &quot;We
are so much obliged to you for coming. It was very good
of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His English was that of a native, as I enviously noted.
He was a young, good-looking fellow, but, as I gazed at
him, a vague resemblance to the stranger of the restaurant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
and to the photograph on the mantelpiece forced itself
on my attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it was no trouble; no trouble at all,&quot; I remarked
cheerfully. &quot;I will come again if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you; but this is our last night, with the exception
of Saturday, when one can get together twenty quite
easily, so there is no need to trouble you, as you perhaps
do not reside in the neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but I do,&quot; I hastened to correct him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case we shall be very pleased to see you,&quot; he
replied readily. &quot;I don&#39;t remember seeing you before in
the district. I presume you are a newcomer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that&#39;s it,&quot; I exclaimed glibly, secretly more puzzled
than ever. He did not remember seeing me before,
nor did the man of the doorstep vouchsafe any information
as to my identity. Then I could certainly not have been
mistaken for somebody else. And yet&mdash;what was the
meaning of that significant invitation: &quot;<i>We are waiting
only for you?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you were a stranger,&quot; he replied. &quot;I
haven&#39;t the pleasure of knowing your name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was the climax. But I concealed my astonishment,
having always found the <i>nil admirari</i> principle the safest
in enterprises of this nature. Should I tell him my real
name? Yes, why not? I was utterly unknown in London,
and my real name would be as effective a disguise as a
pseudonym.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mendoza,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; said the man of the doorstep. &quot;Any relation to
the Mendozas of Highbury?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think not,&quot; I replied, with an air of reflection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah well,&quot; said the second speaker, &quot;we are all
brothers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And sisters.&quot; I remarked gallantly, bowing to the
beautiful maiden. On second thoughts it struck me the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
remark was rather meaningless, but second thoughts have
an awkward way of succeeding first thoughts, which sometimes
interferes with their usefulness. On third thoughts
I went on in my best English, &quot;May I in return be
favored with the pleasure of knowing your name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The second speaker smiled in a melancholy way and
said, &quot;I beg you pardon, I forgot we were as strange to
you as you to us. My name is Radowski, Philip Radowski;
this is my friend Martin, and this my sister
Fanny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I distributed elaborate bows to the trinity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will have a little refreshment before you go?&quot;
said Fanny, with a simple charm that would have made it
impossible to refuse, even if I had been as anxious to go
as I was to stay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh no, I could not think of troubling you,&quot; I replied
warmly, and in due course I was sipping a glass of
excellent old port and crumbling a macaroon.</p>

<p class="indent">This seemed to me the best time for putting out a feeler,
and I remarked lightly, pointing to the photograph on the
mantelpiece, &quot;I did not see that gentleman here to-night.&quot;
Instantly a portentous expression gathered upon all the
faces. I saw I had said the wrong thing. The beautiful
Fanny&#39;s mouth quivered, her eyes grew wistful and
pathetic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father is dead,&quot; she said in a low tone.</p>

<p class="indent">Dead? Her father? A great shock of horror and surprise
traversed my frame. His secret had gone with him
to the grave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dead?&quot; I repeated involuntarily. &quot;Oh, forgive me, I
did not know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not, of course not. I understand perfectly,&quot;
put in her brother soothingly. &quot;You did not know whom
it was we had lost. Yes, it was our father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has he been dead long?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
He seemed a little surprised at the question, but answered:
&quot;It is he we are mourning now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I nodded my head, as if comprehending.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, he was a good man,&quot; said Martin. &quot;I wish we
were all so sure of Heaven.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are very few Jews like him left,&quot; said Fanny
quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alas, he was one of the pious old school,&quot; assented
Martin, shaking his head dolefully.</p>

<p class="indent">My heart was thumping violently as a great wave of
light flooded my brain. These people then were Jews&mdash;that
strange, scattered race of heretics I had often heard
of, but never before come into contact with in my wild
adventurous existence. The strange scene I had witnessed
was not, then, a meeting of conspirators, but a religious
funereal ceremonial; the sorrow of Fanny was filial
grief; the address of the venerable old man a Hebrew
prayer-reading; the short speech of Philip Radowski
probably a psalm in the ancient language all spoke so
fluently. But what had I come to do in that galley?</p>

<p class="indent">All these thoughts flashed upon me in the twinkling of
an eye. There was scarce a pause between Martin&#39;s observation
and Radowski&#39;s remark that followed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was, indeed, pious. It was wonderful how he withstood
the influence of his English friends. You would
never imagine he left Poland quite thirty years ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So I had found the Pole! But was it too late? Anyhow
I resolved to know what <i>I</i> had been summoned for?
The saints spared me the trouble of the search.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Martin, &quot;when you think how ready
he was to go to the houses of mourners, I think it perfectly
disgraceful that we had such difficulty in getting together
ten brother-Jews for the services in his memory. But for
the kindness of Mr. Mendoza I don&#39;t know what we
should have done to-night. In your place, Philip, I confess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
I should have felt tempted to violate the law altogether.
I can&#39;t see that it matters to the Almighty whether you
have nine men or ten men or five men. And I don&#39;t see
why Fanny couldn&#39;t count in quite as well as any man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! Martin,&quot; said Fanny with a shocked look. &quot;How
can you talk so irreligiously? Once we begin to break
the law where are we to stop? Jews and Christians may
as well intermarry at once.&quot; Her righteous indignation
was beautiful to see.</p>

<p class="indent">Two things were clear now. First, I had been mistaken
for a Jew, probably on account of my foreign appearance.
Secondly, Fanny would never wed a Christian. But for
the first fact I would have regretted the second. For a
third thing was clear&mdash;that I loved the glorious Jewess
with all the love of a child of the South. We are not tame
rabbits, we Andalusians: the flash from beauty&#39;s eye
fires our blood and we love instantly and dare greatly.
My heart glowed with gratitude to my patron saint for
having brought about the mistake; a Jew I was and a Jew
I would remain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are quite right, Miss Radowski,&quot; I said, &quot;Jew
and Christian might as well intermarry at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to hear you say so,&quot; said Fanny, turning her
lovely orbs towards me. &quot;Most young men nowadays
are so irreligious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Martin darted a savage glance at me. I saw at once
how the land lay. He was either engaged to my darling
or a <i>fiancé</i> in the making. I surveyed him impassively
from his head to his shoes and decided to stand in them.
It was impossible to permit a man of such dubious religious
principles to link his life with a spiritually-minded
woman like Fanny. Such a union could only bring unhappiness
to both. What she needed was a good pious
Jew, one of the old school. With the help of the saints
I vowed to supply her needs.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
&quot;I think modern young women are quite as irreligious
as modern young men,&quot; retorted Martin, as he left the
room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it is so,&quot; sighed Fanny, the arrow glancing off
unheeded. Then, uplifting her beautiful eyes heavenwards,
she murmured: &quot;Ah, if they had been blessed with fathers
like mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Martin, who had only gone out for an instant, returned
with Fanny&#39;s hat and a feather boa, and observing, &quot;You
must really take a walk at once&mdash;you have been confined
indoors a whole week,&quot; helped her to put them on. I felt
sure his zeal for her health was overbalanced by his enthusiasm
for my departure. I could not very well attach
myself to the walking party&mdash;especially as I only felt an
attachment for one member of it. Disregarding the interruption
I remarked in tones of fervent piety:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be an eternal regret to me that I missed knowing
your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She gave me a grateful look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look!&quot; she said, seating herself on the sofa for a
moment and picking up the richly-bound book lying upon
it. &quot;Look at the motto of exhortation he wrote in my
prayer-book before he died. Our minister says it is in
the purest Hebrew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I went to her side and leaned over the richly-bound
book, which appeared to be printed backwards, and
scanned the inscription with an air of appreciation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Read it,&quot; she said. &quot;Read it aloud! It comforts me
to hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I coughed violently and felt myself growing pale. The
eyes of Martin were upon me with an expression that
seemed waiting to become sardonic. I called inwardly
upon the Holy Mother. There seemed to be only a few
words and after a second&#39;s hesitation I murmured something
in my most inarticulate manner, producing some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
sounds approximately like those I had heard during the
service.</p>

<p class="indent">Fanny looked up at me, puzzled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not understand your pronunciation,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">I felt ready to sink into the sofa.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, I am not surprised,&quot; put in her brother. &quot;From
Mr. Mendoza&#39;s name and appearance I should take him
to be a Sephardi like the Mendozas of Highbury. They
pronounce quite differently from us, Fanny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I commended him to the grace of the Virgin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is so,&quot; I admitted. &quot;And I found it not at all
easy to follow your services.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you an English Sephardi or a native Sephardi?&quot;
asked Martin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A native!&quot; I replied readily. &quot;I was born there.&quot;
Where &quot;there&quot; was I had no idea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know,&quot; said Fanny, looking so sweetly into
my face, &quot;I should like to see your country. Spain has
always seemed to me so romantic, and I dote on Spanish
olives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I was delighted to find I had spoken the truth as to my
nativity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be charmed to escort you,&quot; I said, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled in response.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is easy enough to go anywhere nowadays,&quot; said
Martin surlily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you would go to the devil,&quot; I thought. &quot;That
would certainly be easy enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But it would have been premature to force my own
company upon Fanny any longer. I relied upon the
presence of death and her brother to hinder Martin&#39;s suit
from developing beyond the point it had already reached.
It remained to be seen whether the damage was irreparable.
I went again on the Saturday night, following with
interest the service that had seemed a council-meeting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
This time it began with singing, in which everybody joined
and in which I took part with hearty inarticulateness.
But a little experience convinced me that my course was
beset with pitfalls, that not Mary Jane aspiring to personify
a duchess could glide on thinner ice than I attempting to
behave as one of these strange people, with their endless
and all-embracing network of religious etiquette. To
my joy I discovered that I could pursue my suit without
going to synagogue, a place of dire peril, for it seems
that the Spaniards are a distinct sect, mightily proud of
their blood and their peculiar pronunciation, and the
Radowskis, being Poles, did not expect to see me worshipping
with themselves, which enabled me to continue
my devotions in the Holy Chapel of St. Vincent. It also
enabled me to skate over many awkward moments, the
Poles being indifferently informed as to the etiquette of
their Peninsular cousins. That I should have been twice
taken for one of their own race rather surprised me, for
my physiognomical relationship to it seemed of the slightest.
The dark complexion, the foreign air, doubtless gave
me a superficial resemblance, and in the face it is the surface
that tells. I read up Spanish history and learnt that
many Jews had become Christians during the persecutions
of the Holy Inquisition, and that many had escaped the
fires of the <i>auto-da-fé</i> by feigning conversion, the while
secretly performing their strange rites, and handing down
to their descendants the traditions of secrecy and of
Judaism, these unhappy people being styled Marranos.
Perchance I was sprung from some such source, but there
was no hint of it in my genealogy so far as known to me;
my name Mendoza was a good old Andalusian name, and
my ancestors had for generations been good sons of the
only true Church. The question has no interest for me
now.</p>

<p class="indent">For, although like Cæsar I am entitled to say that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
came, saw, and conquered, conquering not only Fanny
but my rival, yet am I still a bachelor. I had driven
Martin on one side as easily as a steamer bearing down
upon a skiff, yet my own lips betrayed me. It was the
desire to penetrate the mystery of the restaurant that
undid me, for if a woman cannot keep a secret, a man
cannot refrain from fathoming one. The rose-gardens of
Love were open for my walking when the demon in possession
prompted me to speech that silvered the red roses
with hoar-frost and ice.</p>

<p class="indent">One day I sat holding her dear hand in mine. She
permitted me no more complex caresses, being still in
black. Such was the sense of duty of this beautiful,
warm-blooded Oriental creature, that she was as cold as
her father&#39;s tombstone, and equally eulogistic of his virtues.
She spoke of them now, though I would fain have
diverted the talk to hers. Failing that, I seized the
opportunity to solve the haunting puzzle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know, I fancy I once saw your father,&quot; I said,
earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed!&quot; she observed, with much interest. &quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In a restaurant not many miles from here. It was
before noon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In a restaurant?&quot; she repeated. &quot;Hardly very
likely. There isn&#39;t any restaurant near here he would be
likely to go to, and certainly not at the time you mention,
when he would be in the city. You must be mistaken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I shook my head. &quot;I don&#39;t think so. I remember
his face so well. When I saw his photograph I recognized
him at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long ago was it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can tell you exactly,&quot; I said. &quot;The date is graven
on my heart. It was the twenty-fourth of October.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This year?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
&quot;The twenty-fourth of October!&quot; she repeated musingly.
&quot;Only a few weeks before he died. Poor father,
peace be upon him! The twenty-fourth of October, did
you say?&quot; she added, suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter?&quot; I asked. &quot;You are agitated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it is nothing. It cannot be,&quot; she added, more
calmly. &quot;Of course not.&quot; She smiled faintly. &quot;I
thought&mdash;&mdash;&quot; she paused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You thought what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well, I&#39;ll show you I was mistaken.&quot; She rose,
went to the book-case, drew out a little brown-paper
covered volume, and turned over the pages scrutinizingly.
Suddenly a change came over the beautiful face; she
stood motionless, pale as a statue.</p>

<p class="indent">A chill shadow fell across my heart, distracted between
tense curiosity and dread of a tragic solution.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Fanny, what in Heaven&#39;s name is it?&quot; I
breathed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t speak of Heaven,&quot; said Fanny, in strange, harsh
tones, &quot;when you libel the dead thus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Libel the dead? How?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, the twenty-fourth of October was <i>Yom Kippur</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; I said, unimpressed and uncomprehending,
&quot;and what of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stared at me, staggered and clutched at the book-case
for support.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What of it?&quot; she cried, in passionate emotion. &quot;Do
you dare to say that you saw my poor father, who was
righteousness itself, breaking his fast in a restaurant on
the Day of Atonement? Perhaps you will insinuate next
that his speedy death was Heaven&#39;s punishment on him
for his blasphemy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the same instant I saw the truth and my terrible
blunder. This fast-day must be of awful solemnity, and
Fanny&#39;s father must have gone systematically to a surreptitious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
breakfast in that queer, out-of-the-way restaurant.
His nervousness, his want of ease, his terror at
the sight of me, whom he mistook for a brother-Jew, were
all accounted for. Once a year&mdash;the discrepancy in the
date being explained by the discord between Jewish and
Christian chronology&mdash;he hied his way furtively to this
unholy meal, enjoying it and a reputation for sanctity at
the same time. But to expose her father&#39;s hypocrisy to
the trusting, innocent girl would be hardly the way to
advance love-matters. It might be difficult even to repair
the mischief I had already done.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; I said humbly. &quot;You were
right. I was misled by some chance resemblance. If
your father was the pious Jew you paint him, it is impossible
he could have been the man I saw. Yes, and now
I think of it, the eyebrows were bushier and the chin
plumper than those of the photograph.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A sigh of satisfaction escaped her lips. Then her face
grew rigid again as she turned it upon me, and asked in
low tones that cut through me like an icy blast: &quot;Yes,
but what were <i>you</i> doing in the restaurant on the Day of
Atonement?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;?&quot; I stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">Her look was terrible.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;was only having a cup of chocolate,&quot; I replied,
with a burst of inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">As everybody knows, since the pronunciamento of
Pope Paul V., chocolate may be imbibed by good Catholics
without breaking the fasts of the Church. But, alas!
it seems these fanatical Eastern flagellants allow not even
a drop of cold water to pass their lips for over twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad you confess it,&quot; said Fanny, witheringly.
&quot;It shows you have still one redeeming trait. And I am
glad you spoke ill of my poor father, for it has led to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
revelation of your true character before it was too late.
You will, of course, understand, Mr. Mendoza, that our
acquaintance is at an end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fanny!&quot; I cried, frantically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spare me a scene, I beg of you,&quot; she said, coldly.
&quot;You, you the man who pretended to such ardent piety,
to such enthusiasm for our holy religion, are an apostate
from the faith into which you were born, a blasphemer, an
atheist.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I stared at her in dumb horror. I had entangled myself
inextricably. How could I now explain that it was
her father who was the renegade, not I?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Fanny. &quot;Heaven make you a better
Jew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I moved desperately towards her, but she waved me
back. &quot;Don&#39;t touch me,&quot; she cried. &quot;Go, go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But is there no hope for me?&quot; I exclaimed, looking
wildly into the cold, statue-like face, that seemed more
beautiful than ever, now it was fading from my vision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None,&quot; she said. Then, in a breaking voice, she
murmured, &quot;Neither for you nor for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you love me still,&quot; I cried, striving to embrace
her. &quot;You will be my wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She struggled away from me. &quot;No, no,&quot; she said, with
a gesture of horror. &quot;It would be sacrilege to my dead
father&#39;s memory. Rather would I marry a Christian, yes,
even a Catholic, than an apostate Jew like you. Leave
me, I pray you; or, must I ring the bell?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I went&mdash;a sadder and a wiser man. But even my wisdom
availed me not, for when I repaired to the restaurant
to impart it to the proprietor, the last consolation was
denied me. He had sold his business and returned to
Italy.</p>

<p class="indent">To-morrow I start for Turkestan.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE ARITHMETIC AND PHYSIOLOGY OF LOVE.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, have you seen this Fanny Radowski?&quot; said
Lord Silverdale, when he returned the manuscript to the
President of the Old Maids&#39; Club.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course. Didn&#39;t I tell you I had the story from
her own mouth, though I have put it into Mendoza&#39;s?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes, I remember now. It certainly is funny, her
refusing a good Catholic on the ground that he was a bad
Jew. But then according to the story she doesn&#39;t know
he&#39;s a Catholic?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it was I who divined the joke of the situation.
Lookers-on always see more of the game. I saw at once
that if Mendoza were really a Jew, he would never have
been such an ass as to make the slip he did; and so
from this and several other things she told me about her
lover, I constructed deductively the history you have
read. She says she first met him at a mourning service
in memory of her father, and that it is a custom among
her people when they have not enough men to form a
religious quorum (the number is the mystical ten) to
invite any brother Jew who may be passing to step in,
whether he is an acquaintance or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I gathered that from the narrative,&quot; said Lord Silverdale.
&quot;And so she wishes to be an object lesson in
female celibacy, does she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is most anxious to enlist in the Cause.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
&quot;Is she really beautiful, et cetera?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is magnificent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I should say the very member we are looking
for. A Jewess will be an extremely valuable element of
the Club, for her race exalts marriage even above happiness,
and an old maid is even more despised than among
us. The lovely Miss Radowski will be an eloquent protest
against the prejudices of her people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie Dulcimer shook her head quietly. &quot;The racial
accident which makes her seem a desirable member to
you, makes me regard her as impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How so?&quot; cried Silverdale in amazement. &quot;You
surely are not going to degrade your Club by anti-Semitism.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heaven forefend! But a Jewess can never be a
whole Old Maid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look at it mathematically a moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silverdale made a grimace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Consider! A Jewess, orthodox like Miss Radowski,
can only be an Old Maid fractionally. An Old Maid
must make &#39;the grand refusal!&#39;&mdash;she must refuse mankind
at large. Now Miss Radowski, being cut off by her
creed from marrying into any but an insignificant percentage
of mankind, is proportionately less valuable as an
object-lesson; she is unfitted for the functions of Old
Maidenhood in their full potentiality. Already by her
religion she is condemned to almost total celibacy. She
cannot renounce what she never possessed. There are in
the world, roughly speaking, eight million Jews among a
population of a thousand millions. The force of the example,
in other words, her value as an Old Maid, may
therefore be represented by .008.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad you express her as a decimal rather than a
vulgar fraction,&quot; said Lord Silverdale laughing. &quot;But I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
must own your reckoning seems correct. As a mathematical
wrangler you are terrible. So I shall not need to
try Miss Radowski?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; we cannot entertain her application,&quot; said Lillie
peremptorily, the thunder-cloud no bigger than a man&#39;s
hand gathering on her brow at the suspicion that Silverdale
did not take her mathematics seriously. Considering
that in keeping him at arm&#39;s length her motive were
merely mathematical (though Lord Silverdale was not
aware of this) she was peculiarly sensitive on the point.
She changed the subject quickly by asking what poem he
had brought her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not call them poems,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is only between ourselves. There are no critics
about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you so much. I have brought one suggested
by the strange farrago of religions that figured in your
last human document. It is a pæan on the growing hospitality
of the people towards the gods of other nations.
There was a time when free trade in divinities was tabu,
each nation protecting, and protected by, its own. Now
foreign gods are all the rage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are very hard upon the century&mdash;or rather upon
the end of it,&quot; said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The century is dying unshriven,&quot; said the satirist
solemnly. &quot;Its conscience must be stirred. Truly, was
there ever an age which had so much light and so little
sweetness? In the reckless fight for gold Society has
become a mutual swindling association. Cupidity has
ousted Cupid, and everything is bought and sold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Except your poems, Lord Silverdale,&quot; laughed Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">It was tit for the tat of his raillery of her mathematics.</p>

<p class="indent">Before his lordship had time to make the clever retort
the thought of next day, Turple the magnificent brought in
a card.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Winifred Woodpecker?&quot; said Lillie queryingly.
&quot;I suppose it&#39;s another candidate. Show her in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Woodpecker was a tall stately girl, of the kind that
pass for lilies in the flowery language of the novelists.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have I the pleasure of speaking to Miss Dulcimer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I am Miss Dulcimer,&quot; said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And where is the Old Maids&#39; Club?&quot; further inquired
Miss Woodpecker, looking around curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here,&quot; replied Lillie, indicating the epigrammatic
antimacassars with a sweeping gesture. &quot;No, don&#39;t go,
Lord Silverdale. Miss Woodpecker, this is my friend
Lord Silverdale. He knows all about the Club, so you
needn&#39;t mind speaking before him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you know, I read the leader in the <i>Hurrygraph</i>
about your Club this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
&quot;Oh, is there a leader?&quot; said Lillie feverishly. &quot;Have
you seen it, Lord Silverdale?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not sure. At first I fancied it referred to the
Club, but there was such a lot about Ptolemy, Rosa
Bonheur&#39;s animals and the Suez Canal that I can hardly
venture to say what the leader itself was about. And so,
Miss Woodpecker, you have thought about joining our
institution for elevating female celibacy into a fine
art?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish to join at once. Is there any entrance fee?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There <i>is</i>&mdash;experience. Have you had a desirable
proposal of marriage?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eminently desirable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And still you do not intend to marry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not while I live.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that is all the guarantee we want,&quot; said Lord
Silverdale smiling. &quot;Afterwards&mdash;in heaven&mdash;there is no
marrying, nor giving in marriage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is what makes it heaven,&quot; added Lillie. &quot;But
tell us your story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was in this way. I was staying at a boarding-house
in Brighton with a female cousin, and a handsome young
man in the house fell in love with me and we were engaged.
Then my mother came down. Immediately afterwards
my lover disappeared. He left a note for me containing
nothing but the following verses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She handed a double tear-stained sheet of letter-paper
to the President, who read aloud as follows:</p>

<p class="center">A VISION OF THE FUTURE.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well is it for man that he knoweth not what the future will bring
forth.&quot;</p>

Lillie and Silverdale looked at each other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, but,&quot; said Lillie at last, &quot;according to this he
refused you, not you him. Our rules&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mistake me,&quot; interrupted Winifred Woodpecker.
&quot;When the first fit of anguish was over, I saw my Frank
was right, and I have refused all the offers I have had since&mdash;five
in all. It would not be fair to a lover to chain him
to a beauty so transient. In ten or twenty years from
now I shall go the way of all flesh. Under such circumstances
is not marriage a contract entered into under false
pretences? There is no chance of the law of this country
allowing a time-limit to be placed in the contract; celibacy
is the only honest policy for a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Involuntarily Lillie&#39;s hand seized the candidate&#39;s and
gripped it sympathetically. She divined a sister soul.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You teach me a new point of view,&quot; she said, &quot;a finer
shade of ethical feeling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silverdale groaned inwardly; he saw a new weapon going
into the anti-hymeneal armory, and the Old Maids&#39; Club
on the point of being strengthened by the accession of its
first member.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The law will have to accommodate itself to these finer
shades,&quot; pursued Lillie energetically. &quot;It is a rusty
machine out of harmony with the age. Science has discovered
that the entire physical organism is renewed every
seven years, and yet the law calmly goes on assuming that
the new man and the new woman are still bound by the
contract of their predecessors and still possess the good-will
of the original partnership. It seems to me if the
short lease principle demanded by physiology is not to be
conceded, there should at any rate be provincial and
American rights in marriage as well as London rights.
In the metropolis the matrimonial contract should hold
good with A, in the country with B, neither party infringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
the other&#39;s privileges, in accordance with theatrical
analogy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a literal latitudinarianism in morals you will
never get the world to agree to,&quot; laughed Lord Silverdale.
&quot;At least not in theory; we cannot formally sanction
theatrical practice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not laugh,&quot; said Lillie. &quot;Law must be brought
more in touch with life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t it rather <i>vice versâ</i>? Life must be brought more
in touch with law. However, if Miss Woodpecker feels
these fine ethical shades, won&#39;t she be ineligible?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How so?&quot; said the President in indignant surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By our second rule every candidate must be beautiful
and undertake to continue so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Poor little Lillie drooped her head.</p>

<p class="indent">And now it befalls to reveal to the world the jealously-guarded
secret of the English Shakespeare, for how else
can the tale be told of how the Old Maids&#39; Club was
within an ace of robbing him of his bride?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="center">&quot;THE ENGLISH SHAKESPEARE.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which
govern the operations of human nature and by a careful
application of the fine properties of well-selected men, and
a judicious use of every available instrument of log-rolling,
the Mutual Depreciation Society gradually built up a
constitution strong enough to defy every tendency to disintegration.
Hundreds of subtle malcontents floated round,
ready to attack wherever there was a weak point, but
foiled by ignorance of the Society&#39;s existence, and the
members escaped many a fatal shaft by keeping themselves
entirely to themselves. The idea of the Mutual Depreciation
Society was that every member should say what he
thought of the others. The founders, who all took equal
shares in it, were</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tom Brown,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dick Jones,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Harry Robinson.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Their object in founding the Mutual Depreciation
Society was of course to achieve literary success, but they
soon perceived that their phalanx was too small for this,
and as they had no power to add to their number except
by inviting strangers from without, they took steps to induce
three other gentlemen to solicit the privileges of
membership. The second batch comprised,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Taffy Owen,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Andrew Mackay,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Patrick Boyle.</span>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
These six gentlemen being all blessed with youth, health
and incompetence, resolved to capture the town. Their
tactics were very simple, though their first operations
were hampered by their ignorance of one another&#39;s. Thus,
it was some time before it was discovered that Andrew
Mackay, who had been deployed to seize the <i>Saturday
Slasher</i>, had no real acquaintance with the editor&#39;s fencing-master,
while Dick Jones, who had undertaken to bombard
the <i>Acadæum</i>, had started under the impression that
the eminent critic to whom he had dedicated his poems
(by permission) was still connected with the staff. But
these difficulties were eliminated as soon as the Society
got into working order. Everything comes to him who
will not wait, and almost before they had time to wink our
six gentlemen had secured the makings of an Influence.
Each had loyally done his best for himself and the rest,
and the first spoils of the campaign, as announced amid
applause by the Secretary at the monthly dinner, were</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two Morning Papers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Two Evening Papers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Two Weekly Papers.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">They were not the most influential, nor even the best
circulated, still it was not a bad beginning, though of course
only a nucleus. By putting out tentacles in every direction,
by undertaking to write even on subjects with which
they were acquainted, they gradually secured a more or
less tenacious connection with the majority of the better
journals and magazines. On taking stock they found that
the account stood thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three Morning Papers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Four Evening Papers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Eleven Weekly Papers,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thirteen London Letters,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Seven Dramatic Columns,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
<span class="i0">Six Monthly Magazines,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thirteen Influences on Advertisements,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Nine Friendships with Eminent Editors,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Seventeen ditto with Eminent Sub-editors,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Six ditto with Lady Journalists,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fifty-three Loans (at two-and-six each) to Pressmen,</span><br />
<span class="i0">One hundred and nine Mentions of Editor&#39;s Womenkind at Fashionable Receptions.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It showed what could be achieved by six men, working
together shoulder to shoulder for the highest aims in a
spirit of mutual good-will and brotherhood. They were
undoubtedly greatly helped by having all been to Oxford
or Cambridge, but still much was the legitimate result of
their own man&oelig;uvres.</p>

<p class="indent">By the time the secret campaign had reached this stage,
many well-meaning, unsuspecting men, not included in
the above inventory, had been pressed into the service of
the Society, with the members of which they were connected
by the thousand and one ties which spring up
naturally in the intercourse of the world, so that there was
hardly any journal in the three kingdoms on which the
Society could not, by some hook or the other, fasten a paragraph,
if we except such publications as the <i>Newgate
Calendar</i> and <i>Lloyds&#39; Shipping List</i>, which record history
rather than make it.</p>

<p class="indent">Indeed, the success of the Society in this department
was such as to suggest the advisability of having themselves
formally incorporated under the Companies&#39; Acts
for the manufacture and distribution of paragraphs, for
which they had unequalled facilities, and had obtained
valuable concessions, and it was only the publicity required
by law which debarred them from enlarging their
home trade to a profitable industry for the benefit of non-members.
For, by the peculiar nature of the machinery,
it could only be worked if people were unaware of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
existence. They resolved, however, that when they had
made their pile, they would start the newspaper of the
future, which any philosopher with an eye to the trend of
things can see will be a journal written by advertisers for
gentlemen, and will contain nothing calculated to bring a
blush to the cheek of the young person except cosmetics.</p>

<p class="indent">Contemporaneously with the execution of one side of
the Plan of Campaign, the Society was working the supplementary
side. Day and night, week-days and Sundays,
in season and out, these six gentlemen praised themselves
and one another, or got themselves and one another
praised by non-members. There are many ways in which
you can praise an author, from blame downwards. There
is the puff categorical and the puff allusive, the lie direct
and the eulogy insinuative, the downright abuse and the
subtle innuendo, the exaltation of your man or the depression
of his rival. The attacking method of log-rolling
must not be confounded with depreciation. In their outside
campaign, the members used every variety of puff,
but depreciation was strictly reserved for their private
gatherings. For this was the wisdom of the Club, and
herein lay its immense superiority over every other log-rolling
club, that whereas in those childish cliques every
man is expected to admire every other, or to say so, in
the Mutual Depreciation Society the obligation was all
the other way. Every man was bound by the rules to
sneer at the work of his fellow-members and, if he should
happen to admire any of it, at least to have the grace to
keep his feelings to himself. In practice, however, the
latter contingency never arose, and each was able honestly
to express all he thought, for it is impossible for men to
work together for a common object without discovering
that they do not deserve to get it. Needless to point out
how this sagacious provision strengthened them in their
campaign, for not having to keep up the tension of mutual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
admiration, and being able to relax and breathe (and
express themselves) freely at their monthly symposia, as
well as to slang one another in the street, they were able
to write one another up with a clear conscience. It is
well to found on human nature. Every other basis proves
shifting sand. The success of the Mutual Depreciation
Society justified their belief in human nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Not only did they depreciate one another, but they made
reparation to the non-members they were always trying to
write down during business hours, by eulogizing them in
the most generous manner in those blessed hours of leisure
when knife answers fork and soul speaks to soul. At
such times even popular authors were allowed to have a
little merit.</p>

<p class="indent">It was at one of these periods of soul-expansion, when
the most petty-souled feels inclined to loosen the last two
buttons of his waistcoat, that the idea of the English
Shakespeare was first mooted. But we are anticipating,
which is imprudent, as anticipations are seldom realized.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the worst features of prosperity is that it is cloying,
and when the first gloss of novelty and adventure had
worn off, the free lances of the Mutual Depreciation Society
began to bore one another. You can get tired even
of hearing your own dispraises; and the members were
compelled to spice their mutual adverse criticism in the
highest manner, so as to compensate for its staleness.
The jaded appetite must needs be pampered if it is to experience
anything of that relish which a natural healthy
hunger for adverse criticism can command so easily.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the sort of thing that went on at the dinners:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Tom,&quot; said Andrew Mackay, &quot;what in Heaven&#39;s
name made you publish your waste-paper basket under
the name of &#39;Stray Thoughts?&#39; For utter and incomprehensible
idiocy they are only surpassed by Dick&#39;s last
volume of poems. I shouldn&#39;t have thought such things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
could come even out of a lunatic asylum, certainly not
without a keeper. Really you fellows ought to consider
me a little&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We do. We consider you as little as they make them,&quot;
they interrupted simultaneously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t fair to throw all the work on me,&quot; he went on.
&quot;How can I go on saying that Tom Brown is the supreme
thinker of the time, the deepest intellect since Hegel, with
a gift of style that rivals Berkeley&#39;s, if you go on turning
out twaddle that a copy-book would boggle at? How can
I keep repeating that for sure and consummate art, for
unfailing certainty of insight, for unerring visualization,
for objective subjectivity and for subjective objectivity,
for Swinburnian sweep of music and Shakespearean depth
of suggestiveness, Dick Jones can give forty in a hundred
(spot stroke barred) to all other contemporary poets, if
you continue to spue out rhymes as false as your teeth,
rhythms as musical as your voice when you read them,
and words that would drive a drawing-room composer
mad with envy to set them? I maintain, it is not sticking
to the bargain to expose me to the danger of being found
out. You ought at least to have the decency to wrap up
your fatuousness in longer words or more abstruse themes.
You&#39;re both so beastly intelligible that a child can understand
you&#39;re asses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tut, tut, Andrew,&quot; said Taffy Owen, &quot;it&#39;s all very
well of you to talk who&#39;ve only got to do the criticism.
And I think it&#39;s deuced ungrateful of you after we&#39;ve
written you up into the position of leading English critic
to want us to give you straw for your bricks! Do we ever
complain when you call us cataclysmic, creative, esemplastic,
or even epicene? We know it&#39;s rot, but we put
up with it. When you said that Robinson&#39;s last novel
had all the glow and genius of Dickens without his humor,
all the ripe wisdom of Thackeray without his social knowingness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
all the imaginativeness of Shakespeare without
his definiteness of characterization, we all saw at once
that you were incautiously allowing the donkey&#39;s ears to
protrude too obviously from beneath the lion&#39;s skin. But
did anyone grumble? Did Robinson, though the edition
was sold out the day after? Did I, though you had just
called me a modern Buddhist with the soul of an ancient
Greek and the radiant fragrance of a Cingalese tea-planter?
I know these phrases take the public and I try to be
patient.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Owen is right,&quot; Harry Robinson put in emphatically.
&quot;When you said I was a cross between a Scandinavian
skald and a Dutch painter, I bore my cross in silence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but what else can a fellow say, when you give
the public such heterogeneous and formless balderdash
that there is nothing for it but to pretend it&#39;s a new style,
an epoch-making work, the foundation of a new era in
literary art? Really I think you others have out and
away the best of it. It&#39;s much easier to write bad books
than to eulogize their merits in an adequately plausible
manner. I think it&#39;s playing it too low upon a chap, the
way you fellows are going on. It&#39;s taking a mean advantage
of my position.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And who put you into that position, I should like to
know?&quot; yelled Dick Jones, becoming poetically excited.
&quot;Didn&#39;t we lift you up into it on the point of our pens?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fortunately they were not very pointed,&quot; ejaculated
the great critic, wriggling uncomfortably at the suggestion.
&quot;I don&#39;t deny that, of course. All I say is, you&#39;re giving
me away now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You give yourself away,&quot; shrieked Owen vehemently,
&quot;with a pound of that Cingalese tea. How is it Boyle
managed to crack up our plays without being driven to
any of this new-fangled nonsense?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Plays!&quot; said Patrick, looking up moodily.  &quot;Anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
is good enough for plays. You see I can always
fall back on the acting and crack up that. I had to do
that with Owen&#39;s thing at the <i>Lymarket</i>. My notice read
like a gushing account of the play, in reality it was all devoted
to the players. The trick of it is not easy. Those
who can read between the lines could see that there were
only three of them about the piece itself, and yet the outside
public would never dream I was shirking the expression
of an opinion about the merits of the play or the pinning
myself to any definite statement. The only time,
Owen, I dare say, that your plays are literature is when
they are a frost, for that both explains the failure and
justifies you. But, an you love me, Taffy, or if you have
any care for my reputation, do not, I beg of you, be enticed
into the new folly of printing your plays.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But things have come to that stage I <i>must</i> do it,&quot; said
Owen, &quot;or incur the suspicion of illiterateness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no!&quot; pleaded Patrick in horror. &quot;Sooner than
that I will damn all the other printed plays <i>en bloc</i>, and
say that the real literary playwrights, conscious of their
position, are too dignified to resort to this cheap method
of self-assertion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you will not carry out your threat? Remember
how dangerously near you came to exposing me over your
<i>Naquette</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Club laughed. Everyone knew the incident, for it
was Patrick&#39;s stock grievance against the dramatist. Patrick
being out of town, had written his eulogy of this play
of Owen&#39;s from his inner consciousness. On the fourth
night in deference to Owen&#39;s persuasions he had gone to
see <i>Naquette</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">After the tragedy, Owen found him seated moodily in
the stalls, long after the audience had filed out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Knocked you, old man, this time, eh?&quot; queried Owen
laughing complacently.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span></p>

</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
&quot;Yes, all to pieces!&quot; snarled Patrick savagely. &quot;I
shall never believe in my critical judgment again. I dare
not look my notice in the face. When I wrote <i>Naquette</i>
was a masterpiece, I thought at least there would be some
merit in it&mdash;I didn&#39;t bargain for such rot as this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In this wise things would have gone on&mdash;from bad to
worse&mdash;had Heaven not created Cecilia nineteen years
before.</p>

<p class="indent">Cecilia was a tall, fair girl, with dreamy eyes and unpronounced
opinions, who longed for the ineffable with an
unspeakable yearning.</p>

<p class="indent">Frank Grey loved her. He always knew he was going
to and one day he did it. After that it was impossible to
drop the habit. And at last he went so far as to propose.
He was a young lawyer, with a fondness for manly sports
and a wealth of blonde moustache.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cecilia,&quot; he said, &quot;I love you. Will you be mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had a habit of using unconventional phrases.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Frank,&quot; she said gently, and there was a world
and several satellites of tenderness in her tremulous tones.
&quot;It cannot be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, do not decide so quickly,&quot; he pleaded. &quot;I will
not press you for an answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would press you for an answer, if I could,&quot; replied
Cecilia, &quot;but I do not love you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot; he demanded desperately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you are not what I should like you to be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what would you like me to be?&quot; he demanded
eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I told you, you would try to become it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would,&quot; he said, enthusiastically. &quot;Be it what it
may, I would leave no stone unturned. I would work,
strive, study, reform&mdash;anything, everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feared so,&quot; she said despondently. &quot;That is why I
will not tell you. Don&#39;t you understand that your charm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
to me is your being just yourself&mdash;your simple, honest,
manly self? I will not have my enjoyment of your individuality
spoilt by your transmogrification into some unnatural
product of the forcing house. No, Frank, let us
be true to ourselves, not to each other. I shall always
remain your friend, looking up to you as to something
stanch, sturdy, stalwart, coming to consult you (unprofessionally)
in all my difficulties. I will tell you all my secrets,
Frank, so that you will know more of me than if I married
you. Dear friend, let it remain as I say. It is for the
best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Frank went away broken-hearted, and joined the
Mutual Depreciation Society. He did not care what became
of him. How they came to let him in was this. He
was the one man in the world outside who knew all about
them, having been engaged as the Society&#39;s legal adviser.
It was he who made their publishers and managers sit in
an erect position. In applying for a more intimate connection,
he stated that he had met with a misfortune, and
a little monthly abuse would enliven him. The Society
decided that, as he was already half one of themselves,
and as he had never written a line in his life, and so could
not diminish their takings, nothing but good could ensue
from the infusion of new blood. In fact, they wanted
it badly. Their mutual recriminations had degenerated
into mere platitudes. With a new man to insult and be
insulted by, something of the old animation would be restored
to their proceedings. The wisdom of the policy
was early seen, for the first fruit of it was the English
Shakespeare, who for a whole year daily opened out new
and exciting perspectives of sensation and amusement to
a <i>blasé</i> Society. Andrew Mackay had written an enthusiastic
article in the so-called <i>Nineteenth Century</i> on &quot;The
Cochin-China Shakespeare,&quot; and set all tongues wagging
about the new literary phenomenon with whose verses the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
boatmen of the Irrawady rocked their children to sleep on
the cradle of the river, and whose dramas were played in
eight hours slices in the strolling-booths of Shanghai.
Andrew had already arranged with Anyman to bring out
a translation from the original Cochin-Chinese, for there
was no language he could not translate from, provided it
were sufficiently unknown.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cochin-Chinese Shakespeare, indeed!&quot; said Dick
Jones, at the next symposium. &quot;Why, judging from the
copious extracts you gave from his greatest drama, Baby
Bantam, it is <i>the</i> most tedious drivel. You might have
written it yourself. Where is the Shakespearean quality
of this, which is, you say, the whole of Act Thirteen?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Hang-ho: Out, Fu-sia, does your mother know you
are?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Fu-sia: I have no mother, but I have a child.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is the Shakespearean quality?&quot; repeated
Andrew. &quot;Do you not feel the perfect pathos of those
two lines, the infiniteness of incisive significance? To
me they paint the whole scene in two strokes of matchless
simplicity, strophe and anti-strophe. Fu-sia the repentant
outcast and Hang-ho whose honest love she
rejected, stand out as in a flash of lightning. Nay,
Shakespeare himself never wrote an act of such tragic
brevity, packed so full of the sense of anagke. Why, so
far from it being tedious drivel, a lady in whose opinion
I have great confidence and to whom I sent my article,
told me afterwards that she couldn&#39;t sleep till she had
read it.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 591px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;<i>She told me she couldn&#39;t sleep till she had read it.</i>&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The Mutual Depreciation Society burst into a roar of
laughter and Andrew realized that he had put his foot
into it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think it a shame,&quot; broke in Frank Grey,
&quot;that we English are debarred from having a Shakespeare.
There&#39;s been one discovered lately in Belgium,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
and we have already a Dutch Shakespeare, a French
Shakespeare, a German Shakespeare, and an American
Shakespeare. English is the only language in which we
can&#39;t get one. It seems cruel that we should be just the
one nation in the world to be cut off from having a nineteenth
century Shakespeare. Every patriotic Briton must
surely desire that we could discover an English Shakespeare
to put beside these vaunted foreign phenomena.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But an English Shakespeare is a bull,&quot; said Patrick
Boyle, who had a keen eye for such.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Precisely. A John Bull,&quot; replied Frank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Peace. I would willingly look out for one,&quot; said
Andrew Mackay, thoughtfully. &quot;But I cannot venture
to insinuate yet that Shakespeare did not write English.
The time is scarcely ripe, though it is maturing fast.
Otherwise the idea is tempting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why take the words in their natural meaning?&quot;
demanded Tom Brown, the philosopher, in astonishment.
&quot;Is it not unapparent that an English Shakespeare would
be a great writer more saturated with Anglo-Saxon spirit
than Shakespeare, who was cosmic and for all time and
for every place? Hamlet, Othello, Lady Macbeth&mdash;these
are world-types, not English characters. Our English
Shakespeare must be more autochthonic, more chauviniste;
or more provincial and more <i>borné</i>, if you like to put it
that way. His scenes must be rooted in English life, and
his personages must smack of British soil.&quot; There was
much table-thumping when the philosopher ceased.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excellent!&quot; said Andrew. &quot;He must be found. It
will be the greatest boom of the century. But whom can
we discover?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is John P. Smith,&quot; said Tom Brown.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, why John P. Smith? He has merit,&quot; objected
Taffy Owen. &quot;And then he has never been in our
set.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
&quot;And besides he would not be satisfied,&quot; said Patrick
Boyle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true,&quot; said Andrew Mackay reflectively. &quot;I
know, Owen, <i>you</i> would like to be the subject of the discovery.
But I am afraid it is too late. I have taken
your measurements and laid down the chart of your
genius too definitely to alter now. You are permanently
established in business as the dainty neo-Hellenic Buddhist
who has chosen to express himself through farcical
comedy. If you were just starting life, I could work you
into this English Shakespeardom&mdash;I am always happy to
put a good thing in the way of a friend&mdash;but at your age
it is not easy to go into a new line.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, but,&quot; put in Harry Robinson, &quot;if none of us is
to be the English Shakespeare, why should we give over
the appointment to an outsider? Charity begins at home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That <i>is</i> a difficulty,&quot; admitted Andrew, puckering his
brow. &quot;It brings us to a standstill. Seductive, therefore,
as the idea is, I am afraid it has occurred to us too
late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They sat in thoughtful silence. Then suddenly Frank
Grey flashed in with a suggestion that took their breath
away for a moment and restored it to them, charged with
&quot;Bravos&quot; the moment after.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why should he exist at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Why indeed? The more they pondered the matter, the
less necessity they saw for it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Pon my word, Grey, you are right,&quot; said Andrew.
&quot;Right as Talleyrand when he told the thief who insisted
that he must live: <i>Mais, monsieur, je n&#39;en vois pas la
nécessité</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s an inspiration!&quot; said Tom Brown, moved out of
his usual apathy. &quot;We all remember how Whateley
proved that the Emperor Napoleon never existed&mdash;and
the plausible way he did it. How few persons actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
saw the Emperor? How did even these know that what
they saw <i>was</i> the Emperor? Conversely, it should be as
easy as possible for us six to put a non-existent English
Shakespeare on the market. You remember what Voltaire
said of God&mdash;that if there were none it would be
necessary to invent Him. In like manner patriotism
calls upon us to invent the English Shakespeare.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, won&#39;t it be awful fun?&quot; said Patrick Boyle.</p>

<p class="indent">The idea was taken up eagerly&mdash;the <i>modus operandi</i>
was discussed, and the members parted, effervescing with
enthusiasm and anxious to start the campaign immediately.
The English Shakespeare was to be named
Fladpick, a cognomen which once seen would hook itself
on to the memory.</p>

<p class="indent">The very next day a leading article in the <i>Daily Herald</i>
casually quoted Fladpick&#39;s famous line:</p>

<p class="center">&quot;Coffined in English yew, he sleeps in peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And throughout the next month, in the most out-of-the-way
and unlikely quarters, the word Fladpick lurked and
sprang upon the reader. Lines and phrases from Fladpick
were quoted. Gradually the thing worked up,
gathering momentum on its way, and going more and
more of itself, like an ever-swelling snowball which needs
but the first push down the mountain-side. Soon a
leprosy of Fladpick broke out over the journalism of the
day. The very office-boys caught the infection, and in
their book reviews they dragged in Fladpick with an air
of antediluvian acquaintance. Writers were said not to
possess Fladpick&#39;s imagination, though they might have
more sense of style, or they were said not to possess
Fladpick&#39;s sense of style, though they might have more
imagination. Certain epithets and tricks of manner were
described as quite Fladpickian, while others were mentioned
as extravagant and as disdained by writers like,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
say, Fladpick. Young authors were paternally invited to
mould themselves on Fladpick, while others were contemptuously
dismissed as mere imitators of Fladpick. By
this time Fladpick&#39;s poetic dramas began to be asked for
at the libraries, and the libraries said that they were all
out. This increased the demand so much that the libraries
told their subscribers they must wait till the new
edition, which was being hurried through the press, was
published. When things had reached this stage, queries
about Fladpick appeared in the literary and professionally
inquisitive papers, and answers were given, with
reference to the editions of Fladpick&#39;s book. It began
to leak out that he was a young Englishman who had
lived all his life in Tartary, and that his book had been
published by a local firm and enjoyed no inconsiderable
reputation among the English Tartars there, but that the
copies which had found their way to England were extremely
scarce and had come into the hands of only a few
<i>cognoscenti</i>, who being such were enabled to create for
him the reputation he so thoroughly deserved. The next
step was to contradict this, and the press teemed with
biographies and counter-biographies. <i>Dazzler</i> also wired
numerous interviews, but an authoritative statement was
inserted in the <i>Acadæum</i>, signed by Andrew Mackay,
stating that they were unfounded, and paragraphs began
to appear detailing how Fladpick spent his life in dodging
the interviewers. Anecdotes of Fladpick were highly
valued by editors of newspapers, and very plenteous they
were, for Fladpick was known to be a cosmopolitan,
always sailing from pole to pole and caring little for residence
in the country of which he yet bade fair to be the
laureate. These anecdotes girdled the globe even more
quickly than their hero, and they returned from foreign
parts bronzed and almost unrecognizable, to set out
immediately on fresh journeys in their new guise.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
A parody of one of his plays was inserted in a comic
paper, and it was bruited abroad that Andrew Mackay was
collaborating with him in preparing one of his dramas for
representation at the Independent Theatre. This set the
older critics by the ears, and they protested vehemently in
their theatrical columns against the infamous ethics propagated
by the new writer, quoting largely from the specimens
of his work given in Mackay&#39;s article in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>. Patrick, who wrote the dramatic criticism
for seven papers, led the attack upon the audacious iconoclast.
Journalesia was convulsed by the quarrel, and even
young ladies asked their partners in the giddy waltz whether
they were Fladpickiets or Anti-Fladpickiets. You could
never be certain of escaping Fladpick at dinner, for the lady
you took down was apt to take you down by her contempt
of your ignorance of Fladpick&#39;s awfully sweet writings.
Any amount of people promised one another introductions
to Fladpick, and those who had met him enjoyed quite a
reflected reputation in Belgravian circles. As to the Fladpickian
parties, which brother geniuses like Dick Jones
and Harry Robinson gave to the great writer, it was next
to impossible to secure an invitation to them, and comparatively
few boasted of the privilege. Fladpick reaped
a good deal of <i>kudos</i> from refusing to be lionized and
preferring the society of men of letters like himself, during
his rare halting moments in England.</p>

<p class="indent">Long before this stage Mackay had seen his way to introducing
the catch-word of the conspiracy, &quot;The English
Shakespeare.&quot; He defended vehemently the ethics of the
great writer, claiming they were at core essentially at one
with those of the great nation from whence he sprang and
whose very life-blood had passed into his work. This
brought about a reaction, and all over the country the
scribblers hastened to do justice to the maligned writer, and
an elaborate analysis of his most subtle characters was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
announced as having been undertaken by Mr. Patrick
Boyle. And when it was stated that he was to be included
in the Contemporary Men of Letters Series, the advance
orders for the work were far in advance of the demand
for Fladpick&#39;s actual writings. &quot;Shakespearean,&quot; &quot;The
English Shakespeare,&quot; was now constantly used in connection
with his work, and even the most hard-worked
reviewers promised themselves to skim his book in their
next summer holidays. About this time, too, <i>Dazzler</i> unconsciously
helped the Society by announcing that Fladpick
was dying of consumption in a snow-hut in Greenland,
and it was felt that he must either die or go to a
warmer climate, if not both. The news of his phthisic
weakness put the seal upon his genius, and the great
heart of the nation went out to him in his lonely snow-hut,
but returned on learning that the report was a <i>canard</i>.
Still, the danger he had passed through endeared him to
his country, and within a few months Fladpick, the English
Shakespeare, was definitely added to the glories of the
national literature, founding a whole school of writers in
his own country, attracting considerable attention on the
Continent, and being universally regarded as the centre of
the Victorian Renaissance.</p>

<p class="indent">But this was the final stage. A little before it was
reached Cecilia came to Frank Grey to pour her latest
trouble into his ear, for she had carefully kept her promise
of bothering him with her most intimate details, and the
love-sick young lawyer had listened to her petty psychology
with a patience which would have brought him in
considerable fees if invested in the usual way. But this
time the worry was genuine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frank,&quot; she said, &quot;I am in love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young man turned as white as a sheet. The sword
of Damocles had fallen at last, sundering them forever.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With whom?&quot; he gasped.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
&quot;With Mr. Fladpick!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The English Shakespeare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The same!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you have never seen him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have seen his soul. I have divined him from his
writings. I have studied Andrew Mackay&#39;s essays on
him. I feel that he and I are <i>en rapport</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But this is madness!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it is. I have tried to fight against it. I have
applied for admission to the Old Maids&#39; Club, so as to
stifle my hopeless passion. Once I have joined Miss Dulcimer&#39;s
Society, I shall perhaps find peace again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great Heavens! Think; think before you take this
terrible step. Are you sure it is love you feel, not admiration?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it is love. At first I thought it was admiration,
and probably it was, for I was not likely to be mistaken
in the analysis of my feelings, in which I have had much
practice. But gradually I felt it efflorescing and sending
forth tender shoots clad in delicate green buds, and a
sweet wonder came upon me, and I knew that love was
struggling to get itself born in my soul. Then suddenly
the news came that he I loved was ill, dying in that lonely
snow-hut in grim Greenland, and then in the tempest of
grief that shook me I knew that my life was bound up with
his. Watered by my hot tears, the love in my heart bourgeoned
and blossomed like some strange tropical passion-flower,
and when the reassuring message that he was
strong and well flashed through the world, I felt that if he
lived not for me, the universe were a blank and next year&#39;s
daisies would grow over my early grave.&quot;</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;<i>He I loved was dying in Greenland.</i>&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">She burst into tears. &quot;A great writer has always been
the ideal which I would not tell you of. It is the one
thing I have kept from you. But oh, Frank, Frank, he can
never be mine. He will probably never know of my existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
and the most I can ever hope for is his autograph.
To-morrow I shall join the Old Maids&#39; Club, and then all
will be over.&quot; A paroxysm of hopeless sobs punctuated
her remarks.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a terrible position. Frank groaned inwardly.</p>

<p class="indent">How was he to explain to this fair young thing that
she loved nobody and could never hope to marry him?
There was no doubt that with her intense nature and
her dreamy blue eyes she would pine away and die. Or
worse, she would live to be an old maid.</p>

<p class="indent">He made an effort to laugh it off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tush!&quot; he said, &quot;all this is mere imagination. I
don&#39;t believe you really love anybody!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frank!&quot; She drew herself up, stony and rigid, the
warm tears on her poor white face frozen to ice. &quot;Have
you nothing better than this to say to me, after I have
shown you my inmost soul?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The wretched young lawyer&#39;s face returned from white
to red. He could have faced a football team in open
combat, but these complex psychical positions were beyond
the healthy young Philistine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For&mdash;or&mdash;give me,&quot; he stammered. &quot;I&mdash;I am&mdash;I&mdash;that
is to say, Fladpick&mdash;oh how can I explain what I
mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cecilia sobbed on. Every sob seemed to stick in
Frank&#39;s own throat. His impotence maddened him.
Was he to let the woman he loved fret herself to death
for a shadow? And yet to undeceive her were scarcely
less fatal. He could have cut out the tongue that first
invented Fladpick. Verily, his sin was finding him
out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why can you not explain what you mean?&quot; wept
Cecilia.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I&mdash;oh, hang it all&mdash;because I am the cause
of your grief.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
&quot;You?&quot; she said. A strange, wonderful look came
into her eyes. The thought shot from her eyes to his and
dazzled them.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes! why not? why should he not sacrifice himself to
save this delicate creature from a premature tomb? Why
should he not become &quot;the English Shakespeare?&quot;
True, it was a heavy burden to sustain, but what will a
man not dare or suffer for the woman he loves? Moreover,
was he not responsible for Fladpick&#39;s being, and
thus for all the evil done by his Frankenstein? He had
employed Fladpick for his own amusement and the Employers&#39;
Liability Act was heavy upon him. The path of
abnegation, of duty, was clear. He saw it and he went
for it then and there&mdash;went, like a brave young Englishman,
to meet his marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I am glad you love Mr. Fladpick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; she murmured breathlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I love you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&mdash;I&mdash;do&mdash;not&mdash;love&mdash;you,&quot; she said slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will, when I tell you it is I who have provoked
your love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frank, is this true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On my word of honor as an Englishman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are Fladpick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I am not, he does not exist. There is no such person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Frank, this is no cruel jest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cecilia, it is the sacred truth. Fladpick is nobody, if
he is not Frank Grey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you never lived in Tartary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not. All that about Fladpick is the veriest
poetry. But I did not mind it, for nobody suspected me.
I&#39;ll introduce you to Andrew Mackay himself, and you
shall hear from his own lips how the newspapers have
lied about Fladpick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
&quot;My noble, modest boy! So this was why you were
so embarrassed before! But why not have told <i>me</i> that
you were Fladpick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I wanted you to love me for myself alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She fell into his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frank&mdash;Frank&mdash;Fladpick, my own, my English Shakespeare,&quot;
she sobbed ecstatically.</p>

<p class="indent">At the next meeting of the Mutual Depreciation Society,
a bombshell in a stamped envelope was handed to Mr.
Andrew Mackay. He tore open the envelope and the
explosion followed&mdash;as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hereby beg to tender the resignation of my membership
in your valued Society, as well as to anticipate
your objections to my retaining the post of legal adviser I
have the honor to hold. I am about to marry&mdash;the cynic
will say I am laying the foundation of a Mutual Depreciation
Society of my own. But this is not the reason of my
retirement. That is to be sought in my having accepted
the position of the English Shakespeare which you were
good enough to open up for me. It would be a pity to let
the pedestal stand empty. From the various excerpts you
were kind enough to invent, especially from the copious
extracts in Mr. Mackay&#39;s articles, I have been able to
piece together a considerable body of poetic work, and by
carefully collecting every existing fragment, and studying
the most authoritative expositions of my aims and methods,
I have constructed several dramas, much as Professor
Owen re-constructed the mastodon from the bones that
were extant. As you know I had never written a line in
my life before, but by the copious aid of your excellent
and genuinely helpful criticism I was enabled to get along
without much difficulty. I find that to write blank verse
you have only to invert the order of the words and keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
on your guard against rhyme. You may be interested to
know that the last line in the last tragedy is:</p>

<p class="center">&#39;Coffined in English yew he sleeps in peace.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">When written, I got my dramas privately printed with a Tartary
trademark, after which I smudged the book and sold the
copyright to Makemillion &amp; Co. for ten thousand pounds.
Needless to say I shall never write another book. In taking
leave of you I cannot help feeling that, if I owe you
some gratitude for the lofty pinnacle to which you have
raised me, you are also not unindebted to me for finally
removing the shadow of apprehension that must have
dogged you in your sober moments&mdash;I mean the fear of
being found out. Mr. Andrew Mackay, in particular, as
the most deeply committed, I feel owes me what he can
never hope to repay for my gallantry in filling the mantle
designed by him, whose emptiness might one day have been

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="center">THE OLD YOUNG WOMAN AND THE NEW.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Providence has granted what I dared not hope for,&quot;
wrote Cecilia to the President.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she had hoped for it, Providence would not have
granted it,&quot; interpolated the Honorary Trier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is hardly the moment for jesting,&quot; said Lillie,
with marked pique.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me. The moment for jesting is surely when
you have received a blow. In a happy crisis jesting is a
waste of good jokes. The retiring candidate does not state
<i>what</i> Providence has granted, does she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Lillie savagely. &quot;She was extremely reticent
about her history&mdash;reticent almost to the point of
indiscretion. But I daresay it&#39;s a husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, then it can hardly be Providence that has granted
it,&quot; said Silverdale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Providence is not always kindly,&quot; said Lillie laughing.
The gibe at Benedicts restored her good-humor and when
the millionaire strolled into the Club she did not immediately
expel him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Lillie,&quot; he said, &quot;when are you going to give
the <i>soirée</i> to celebrate the foundation of the Club? I am
staying in town expressly for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As soon as possible, father. I am only waiting for
some more members.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
&quot;Why, have you any difficulty about getting enough?
I seem always to be meeting young ladies on the staircases.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are so exclusive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it seems. You exclude even me,&quot; grumbled the
millionaire. &quot;I can&#39;t make out why you are so hard to
please. A more desirable lot of young ladies I never wish
to see. I should never have believed it possible that such
a number of pretty girls would be anxious to remain single
merely for the sake of a principle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see!&quot; said Lillie eagerly, &quot;we shall be a standing
proof to men of how little they have understood our
sex.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men do not need any proof of that,&quot; remarked Lord
Silverdale dryly.</p>

<p class="indent">This time it was Lillie whom Turple the magnificent
prevented from making the retort which was not on the
tip of her tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A gentleman who gives his name as a lady is waiting
in the ante-room,&quot; he announced.</p>

<p class="indent">They all stared hard at Turple the magnificent, almost
tempted to believe he was joking and that the end of the
world was at hand.</p>

<p class="indent">But the countenance of Turple the magnificent was as
stolid and expressionless as a Bath bun. He might have
been beaming behind his face, possibly even the Old
Maids&#39; Club tickled him vastly, so that his mental midriff
was agitated convulsively; but this could not be known
by outsiders.</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie took the card he tendered her and read aloud:
&quot;Nelly Nimrod.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nelly Nimrod!&quot; cried the Honorary Trier. &quot;Why,
that&#39;s the famous girl who travelled from Charing Cross
to China-Tartary on an elephant and wrote a book about
it under the pen-name of Wee Winnie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
&quot;Shall I show him in?&quot; interposed Turple the magnificent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Lillie eagerly. &quot;Father, you must
go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no! Not if it&#39;s only a gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may be only no lady,&quot; murmured Silverdale. Lillie
caught the words and turned upon him the dusky splendors
of her fulminant eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Et tu, Brute!</i>&quot; she said. &quot;Do you too hold that
false theory that womanliness consists in childishness?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, nor that other false theory that it consists in
manliness,&quot; retorted the Honorary Trier.</p>

<p class="indent">The entry of Nelly Nimrod put an end to the dispute.
In the excitement of the moment no one noticed that the
millionaire was still leaning against an epigram.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-morning, Miss Dulcimer. I am charmed to make
your acquaintance,&quot; said Wee Winnie, gripping the President&#39;s
soft hand with painful cordiality. She was elegantly
attired in a white double-breasted waistcoat, a zouave
jacket, a check-tweed skirt, gaiters, a three inch collar, a
tricorner hat, a pair of tanned gloves and an eyeglass.
In her hand she carried an ebony stick. Her hair was
parted at the side. Nelly was nothing if not original,
so that when the spectator looked down for the divided
skirt he was astonished not to find it. Wee Winnie in
fact considered it ungraceful and <i>Divide et Impera</i> a contradiction
in terms. She was a tall girl, and looked handsome
even under the most masculine conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am happy to make yours,&quot; returned the President.
&quot;Is it to join the Old Maids&#39; Club that you have
called?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is. Wherever there is a crusade you will always
find me in the van. I don&#39;t precisely know your objects
yet, but any woman who strikes out anything new commands
my warmest sympathies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
&quot;Be seated, Miss Nimrod. Allow me to introduce
Lord Silverdale&mdash;an old friend of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And of mine,&quot; replied Nelly, bowing with a sweet
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed!&quot; cried Lillie flushing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the spirit, only in the spirit,&quot; said Nelly. &quot;His
lordship&#39;s &#39;Poems of Passion&#39; formed my sole reading
in the deserts of China-Tartary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the letter, you should say then,&quot; said the peer.
&quot;By the way, you are confusing me with a minor poet,
Silverplume, and his book is not called Poems of Passion
but Poems of Compassion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah well, there isn&#39;t much difference,&quot; said Nelly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, according to the proverb Compassion <i>is</i> akin to
Passion,&quot; admitted Silverdale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Miss Nimrod,&quot; put in Lillie, &quot;our object is easily
defined. We are an association of young and beautiful
girls devoted to celibacy in order to modify the meaning
of the term &#39;Old Maid.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nelly Nimrod started up enthusiastically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bravo, old girl!&quot; she cried, slapping the President on
the back. &quot;Put me down for a flag. I catch the conception
of the campaign. It is magnificent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it is not war,&quot; said Lillie. &quot;Our methods are
peaceful, unaggressive. Our platform is merely metaphorical.
Our lesson is the self-sufficiency of spinsterhood.
We preach it by existing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not exist by preaching it,&quot; added Silverdale. &quot;This
is not one of the cliques of the shrieking sisterhood?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean by the term shrieking sisterhood,&quot;
said Nelly. &quot;I use it to denote the mice-fearing classes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hear, hear,&quot; said Lillie. &quot;It is true, Miss Nimrod,
that our members are required not to exhibit in public,
but only because that is a part of the old unhappy signification
of &#39;Old Maid.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
&quot;I quite understand. You would not call a book a
public exhibition of oneself, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not&mdash;if it is an autobiography,&quot; said Silverdale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all right then. My book <i>is</i> autobiographical.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew a celebrity once,&quot; said Silverdale, &quot;a dreadfully
shy person. All his life he lived retired from the world,
and even after his death he concealed himself behind an
autobiography.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie frowned at these ironical insinuations, though Miss
Nimrod appeared impervious to them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not concealed myself,&quot; she said simply. &quot;All
I thought and did is written in my book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I liked that part about the fleas,&quot; murmured the millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s that? Didn&#39;t catch that,&quot; said Nelly, looking
round in the direction of the voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good gracious, father, haven&#39;t you gone?&quot; cried Lillie,
no less startled. &quot;It&#39;s too bad. You are spoiling one of
my best epigrams. Couldn&#39;t you lean against something
else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before the millionaire could be got rid of, Turple the
magnificent reappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A lady who gives the name of a gentleman,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">The assemblage pricked up its ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What name?&quot; asked Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Jack, she said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s her surname,&quot; said Lillie, in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">Turple the magnificent stood reproved a moment, then
he went out to fetch the lady. The gathering was already
so large that Lillie thought there was nothing to be gained
by keeping her waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jack proved to be an extremely eligible candidate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
so far as appearances went. She bowed stiffly on being
introduced to Miss Nimrod.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I ask if that is to be the uniform of the Old Maids&#39;
Club?&quot; she inquired of the President. &quot;Because if so I
am afraid I have made a mistaken journey. It is as a protest
against unconventional females that I designed to join
you.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 669px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;<i>Is that the uniform of the Old Maids&#39; Club?</i>&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it to me you are referring as an unconventional
female?&quot; asked Miss Nimrod, bridling up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Miss Jack, with exquisite politeness.
&quot;I lay stress upon your sex, merely because it is not obvious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I <i>am</i> an unconventional female, and I glory in it,&quot;
said Nelly Nimrod, seating herself astride the sofa. &quot;I did
not expect to hear the provincial suburban note struck
within these walls. I claim the right of every woman to
lead her own life in her own toilettes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And a pretty life you have led!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have, indeed!&quot; cried Miss Nimrod, goaded almost
to oratory by Miss Jack&#39;s taunts. &quot;Not the ugly,
unlovely life of the average woman. I have exhausted
all the sensations which are the common guerdon of youth
and health and high spirits, and which have for the most
part been selfishly monopolized by man. The splendid
audacity of youth has burnt in my veins and fired me to
burst my swaddling clothes and strike for the emancipation
of my sex. I have not merely played cricket in a white
shirt and lawn tennis in a blue serge skirt, I have not only
skated in low-heeled boots and fenced in corduroy knickerbockers,
but I have sailed the seas in an oil-skin jacket
and a sou&#39;-wester and swum them in nothing and walked
beneath them in the diver&#39;s mail. I have waded after
salmon in long boots and caught trout in tweed knickerbockers
and spats. Nay, more! I have proclaimed the
dignity of womanhood upon the moors, and have shot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
grouse in brown leather gaiters and a sweet Norfolk
jacket with half-inch tucks. But this is not the climax, I
have&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Wee Winnie on her Travels.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know. You are Wee Winnie. You travelled
alone from Charing Cross to China-Tartary. I have not
read your book, but I have heard of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what have you heard of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That it is in bad taste.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your remark is in worse,&quot; interposed Lillie severely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ladies, ladies!&quot; murmured Silverdale. &quot;This is the
first time we have had two of them in the room together,&quot;
he thought. &quot;I suppose when the thing is once started we
shall change the name to the Kilkenny Cats&#39; Club.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In bad taste, is it?&quot; said Miss Nimrod, promptly
whipping a book out of her skirt pocket. &quot;Well, here is
the book. If you can find one passage in bad taste I&#39;ll&mdash;I&#39;ll
delete it in the next edition. There!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She pushed the book into the hands of Miss Jack, who
took it rather reluctantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; asked Miss Jack, pointing to a weird
illustration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a picture of me on my elephant, sketched by
myself. Do you mean to say there&#39;s any bad taste about
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no; I merely asked for information. I didn&#39;t
know what animal it was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You astonish me,&quot; said the artist. &quot;Have you never
been to a circus? Yes, this is Mumbo Jumbo himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely, Miss Jack,&quot; said Lord Silverdale gravely.
&quot;You must have heard, if you have not read, how Miss
Nimrod chartered an elephant, packed up her Kodak
and a few bonnet-boxes and rode him on the curb through
Central Asia. But may I ask, Miss Nimrod, why you
did not enrich the book with more sketches? There is
only this one. All the rest are Kodaks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
&quot;Well, you see, Lord Silverdale, it&#39;s simpler to photograph.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps, but your readers miss the artistic quality
that pervades this sketch. I am glad you made an exception
in its favor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, only because one can&#39;t Kodak oneself. Everything
else I caught as I flew past.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you catch any Tartars?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hundreds. I destroyed most of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the way, you did not come across Mr. Fladpick in
Tartary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The English Shakespeare? Oh, yes! I lunched with
him. He is charm&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, here are the fleas!&quot; interrupted Miss Jack.</p>

<p class="indent">The millionaire
started as if he had
been stung.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t have them
taken apart from the
context, I warn you.
That wouldn&#39;t be
fair,&quot; said Miss Nimrod.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, I will
read the whole passage,&quot;
said Miss Jack.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Mumbo Jumbo
bucked violently (<i>see
illustration</i>) but I settled
myself tightly on the saddle and gave
myself up to meditations
on the vanity of Life-guardsmen. Mumbo Jumbo
seemed, however, determined to have his fling, and
bounded about with the agility of an india-rubber ball.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
At last his convulsions became so terrific that I grew
quite nervous about my fragile bonnet-boxes. They
might easily dash one another to bits. I determined to
have leather hat-boxes the next time I travelled in untrodden
paths. &quot;Steady, my beauty, steady!&quot; I cried.
Recognizing my familiar accents, my pet easied a little.
To pacify him entirely I whistled &#39;Ba, ba, ba, boodle-dee,&#39;
to him, but his contortions recommenced and
became quite grotesque. First he lifted one paw high in
the air, then he twirled his trunk round the corner, then
the first paw came down with a thud that shook the desert,
while the other three paws flew up towards the sky. It
suddenly occurred to me that he was dancing to the air
of &#39;Ba, ba, ba, boodle-dee,&#39; and I laughed so loud and long,
that any stray Mahatma who happened to be smoking at
the door of his cave in the cool of the evening must have
thought me mad. But while I was laughing, Mumbo
Jumbo continued to stand upon his tail, so that I saw it
could not be &#39;Ba, ba, ba, boodle-dee&#39; he was suffering
from. I wondered whether perhaps he could be teething&mdash;or
should I say, tusking? I do not know whether
elephants get a second set, or whether they cut their
wisdom tusks, but, as they are so sagacious, I suppose they
do. Suddenly the consciousness of what was really the
matter with him flashed sharply upon my brain. I looked
down upon my hand, and there, poised lightly yet firmly,
like a butterfly on a lily, was a giant flea. Instantly,
without uttering a single cry or reeling in my saddle, I
grasped the situation; and coolly seizing the noxious insect
with my other hand, I choked the life out of him,
while Mumbo Jumbo cantered along in restored calm.
The sensitive beast had evidently been suffering untold
agonies.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Lord Silverdale,&quot; said Miss Nimrod, &quot;I appeal
to you. Is there anything in that passage in the least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
calculated to bring a blush to the cheek of the young
person?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, there is not,&quot; said his lordship emphatically.
&quot;Only I wish you had caught that flea with your Kodak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; said Miss Nimrod.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I have always longed to see him. A flea
that could penetrate the pachydermatous hide of an
elephant must have been, indeed, a monster. In England
we only see that sort under microscopes. They seem to
thrive nowhere else. Yours must have been one that had
escaped from under the lens. He was magnified three
thousand diameters and he never recovered from it. You
probably took him over in your trunk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t,&quot; protested Miss Nimrod.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, Mumbo Jumbo did in his.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; interposed Miss Jack. &quot;We are getting
off the point. I did not say the passage was calculated
to raise a blush, I said it was a grave error of taste.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a mere flea-bite,&quot; broke in the millionaire, impatiently.
&quot;I liked it when I first read it, and I like it now
I hear it again. It is a touch of nature that brings the
Tartary traveller home to every fireside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides,&quot; added Lord Silverdale. &quot;The introduction
of the butterfly and the lily makes it quite poetical.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; interposed the President, at
last, &quot;we are not here to discuss entomology or æsthetics.
You stated, Miss Jack, that you thought of joining us as
a protest against female unconventionally.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said unconventional females,&quot; persisted Miss Jack.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Even so, I do not follow you,&quot; said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is extremely simple. I am unable to marry because
I have a frank nature, not given to feigning or
fawning. I cannot bring a husband what he expects nowadays
in a wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that?&quot; inquired Lillie curiously.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
&quot;A chum,&quot; answered Miss Jack. &quot;Formerly a man
wanted a wife, now he wants a woman to sympathize with
his intellectual interests, to talk with him intelligently
about his business, discuss politics with him&mdash;nay, almost
to smoke with him. Tobacco for two is destined to be
the ideal of the immediate future. The girls he favors
are those who flatter him by imitating him. It is women
like Wee Winnie who have depraved his taste. There is
nothing the natural man craves less for than a clever,
learned wife. Only he has been talked over into believing
that he needs intellectual companionship, and now he
won&#39;t be happy till he gets it. I have escaped politics
and affairs all my life, and I am determined not to marry
into them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a humiliating confession!&quot; sneered Miss Nimrod.
&quot;It is a pity you don&#39;t wear doll&#39;s-clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I claim for every woman the right to live her own life
in her own toilettes,&quot; retorted Miss Jack. &quot;The sneers
about dolls are threadbare. I have watched these intellectual
camaraderies, and I say they are a worse injustice
to woman than any you decry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That sounds a promising paradox,&quot; muttered Lord
Silverdale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The man expects the woman to talk politics&mdash;but he
refuses to take a reciprocal interest in the woman&#39;s sphere
of work. He will not talk nursery or servants. He will
preach economy, but he will not talk it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true,&quot; said Lillie impressed. &quot;What reply
would you make to that, Miss Nimrod?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no possible reply,&quot; said Miss Jack hurriedly.
&quot;So much for the mock equality which is the cant of the
new husbandry. How stands the account with the new
young womanhood? The young ladies who are clamoring
for equality with men want to eat their cake and to
have it too. They want to wear masculine hats, yet to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
keep them on in the presence of gentlemen; to compete
with men in the market-place, yet to take their seats inside
omnibuses on wet days and outside them on sunny; to be
&#39;pals&#39; with men in theatres and restaurants and shirk
their share of the expenses. I once knew a girl named
Miss Friscoe who cultivated Platonic relations with young
men, but never once did she pay her half of the hansom.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; interrupted Wee Winnie. &quot;My whole
life gives the lie to your superficial sarcasm. In my
anxiety to escape these obvious objurgations I have even,
I admit it, gone to the opposite extreme. I have made it
a point to do unto men as they would have done unto me,
if I had not anticipated them. I always defray the bill
at the restaurants, buy the stalls at the box-office and receive
the curses of the cabman. If I see a young gentleman
to the train, I always get his ticket for him and help him
into the carriage. If I convey him to a ball, I bring him
a button-hole, compliment him upon his costume and say
soft nothings about his moustache, while if I go to a dance
alone I stroll in about one in the morning, survey mankind
through my eyeglass, loll a few minutes in the doorway,
then go downstairs to interview the supper, and
having sated myself with chicken, champagne and trifle
return to my club.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To your club!&quot; exclaimed the millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;do you think the Old Maids&#39; is the only one in
London? Mine is the Lady Travellers&#39;&mdash;do you know it,
Miss Dulcimer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;o,&quot; said Lillie shamefacedly. &quot;I only know the
Writers&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, are you a member of that? I&#39;m a member, too.
It&#39;s getting a great club now, what with Ellaline Rand
(Andrew Dibdin, you know) and Frank Maddox and Lillie
Dulcimer. I wonder we haven&#39;t met there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m so taken up with my own club,&quot; explained Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
&quot;Naturally. But you must come and dine with me
some evening at the Lady Travellers&#39;&mdash;snug little club&mdash;much
cosier than the Junior Widows&#39;, and they give you
a better bottle of wine, and then the decorations are so
sweetly pretty. The only advantage the Junior Widows&#39;
has over the Lady Travellers&#39; is the lovely smoking-room
lined with mirrors, which makes it much nicer when you
have men to dinner. I always ask them there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, are you allowed to have men?&quot; asked Miss
Jack.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly&mdash;in the dining and smoking rooms. Then
of course there are special gentlemen&#39;s nights. We get
down a lot of music-hall talent just to let them have a
peep into Bohemia.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how can you be a member of the Junior Widows&#39;?&quot;
asked the millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not an original member. But when they
were in want of funds they let a lot of married women
and girls in, without asking questions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose, though, they all look forward to becoming
widows in time,&quot; observed Silverdale cheerfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh no,&quot; replied Miss Nimrod emphatically. &quot;I don&#39;t
say that if they hadn&#39;t let me in, the lovely smoking-room
lined with mirrors mightn&#39;t have tempted me to marry so
as to qualify myself. But as it is, thank Heaven, I&#39;m an
Old Maid for life. Why should I give up my freedom and
the comforts of my club and saddle myself with a husband
who would want to monopolize my society and who would
be jealous of my bachelor friends and want me to cut them,
who would hanker to read my letters, who would watch
my comings and goings, and open my parcels of cosmetics
marked confectionery? Doubtless in the bad old times
which Miss Jack has the inaptitude to regret, marriage
was the key to comparative freedom, but in these days
when woman has at last emancipated herself from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
thraldom of mothers, it would be the height of folly to
replace them by husbands. Will you tell me, Miss Jack,
what marriage has to offer to a woman like me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied Miss Jack.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aha! You admit it!&quot; cried Miss Nimrod triumphantly.
&quot;Why should I embrace a profession to which I
feel no call? Marriage has practically nothing to offer
any independent woman except a trousseau, wedding presents,
and the jealousy of her female friends. But what
are these weighed against the cramping of her individuality?
Perhaps even children come to fetter her life still
more and she has daughters who grow up to be younger
than herself. No, the future lies with the Old Maid; the
woman who will retain her youth and her individuality
till death; who dies, but does not surrender. The ebbing
tide is with you, Miss Jack; the flowing tide is with us.
The Old Maids&#39; Club will be the keystone of the arch of
the civilization of to-morrow, and Miss Dulcimer&#39;s name
will go down to posterity linked with&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord Silverdale&#39;s,&quot; said the millionaire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father! What are you saying?&quot; murmured Lillie,
abashed before her visitors.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was reminding Miss Nimrod of the part his lordship
has played in the movement. It is not fair posterity
should give you all the credit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have done nothing for the club&mdash;nothing,&quot; said the
peer modestly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I will do the same,&quot; said Miss Jack. &quot;I came
here under the delusion that I was going to associate myself
with a protest against the defeminization of my sex,
with a band of noble women who were resolved never
to marry till the good old times were restored and marriages
became true marriages once more. But instead of
that I find&mdash;Wee Winnie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are, indeed, fortunate beyond your deserts,&quot; replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
that lady. &quot;You may even hope to encounter a suitable
husband some day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do hope,&quot; said Miss Jack frankly. &quot;But I will
never marry till I meet a thoroughly conventional
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There I have the advantage of you,&quot; said Miss Nimrod.
&quot;I shall never marry till I meet a thoroughly <i>un</i>conventional
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A thoroughly unconventional man would never want
to marry at all,&quot; said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not. That is the beauty of the situation.
That is the paradox which guarantees my spinsterhood.
Well, I&#39;ve had a charming afternoon, Miss Dulcimer, but
I must really run away now. I hate keeping men waiting,
and I have an appointment with a couple of friends at the
Junior Widows&#39;. Such fun! While riding in the park
before lunch, I met Guy Fledgely out for a constitutional
with his father, the baronet. I asked Guy if he would
have a chop with me at the club this evening, and what do
you think? The baronet coughed and looked at Guy
meaningly, and Guy blushed and hemmed and hawed and
looked sheepish and at last gave me to understand he
never went out to dine with a lady unless accompanied by
his father. So I had to ask the old man, too. Isn&#39;t it
awful? By the way, Miss Jack, I should be awfully delighted
if you would join our party!&quot;</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Wee Winnie,&quot; said Miss Jack, disdainfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But think how thoroughly conventional the baronet
is! He won&#39;t even let his son go out without a chaperon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true,&quot; admitted Miss Jack, visibly impressed.
&quot;He is about the most conventional man I ever heard
of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A widower, too,&quot; pursued Miss Nimrod, pressing her
advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Jack hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
&quot;And he dines seven sharp at the Junior Widows&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah then, there is no time to lose,&quot; said Miss Jack.
They went out arm in arm.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you seen Patrick Boyle&#39;s poem in the <i>Playgoers&#39;
Review</i>?&quot; asked Lillie, when the club was clear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean the great dramatic critic&#39;s? No, I haven&#39;t
seen it, but I have seen extracts and eulogies in every
paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have it here complete,&quot; said Lillie. &quot;It is quite
interesting to find there is a heart beneath the critic&#39;s
waistcoat. Read it aloud. No, you don&#39;t want the
banjo!&quot;</p>

<p class="center">THE MYSTERIOUS ADVERTISER.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">&quot;<span class="smcap">Junior Widows&#39; Club.</span><br />
&quot;<i>Midnight.</i></p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Dulcimer</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just a line to tell you what a lovely evening we have
had. The baronet seemed greatly taken with Miss Jack
and she with him, and they behaved in a conventional
manner. Guy and I were able to have a real long chat
and he told me all his troubles. It appears that he has
just been thrown over by his promised bride under circumstances
of a most peculiar character. I gave him the
sympathy he needed, but at the same time thought to
myself, aha! here is another member for the Old Maids&#39;
Club. You rely on me, I will build you up a phalanx of
Old Maids that shall just swamp the memory of Hippolyte
and her Amazons. I got out of Guy the name and
address of the girl who jilted him. I shall call upon Miss
Sybil Hotspur the first thing in the morning, and if I do
not land her my name is not</p>

<p class="center">&quot;Yours cheerily,</p>

<p class="author">&quot;<span class="smcap">Wee Winnie</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;This may be awkward,&quot; said the Honorary Trier, returning
the letter to the President. &quot;Miss Nimrod seems to
take her own election for granted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
&quot;And to think that we are anxious for members,&quot; added
Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we ought to have somebody to replace Miss
Jack,&quot; said Silverdale, with a suspicion of a smile. &quot;But
do you propose to accept Wee Winnie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know&mdash;she is certainly a remarkable girl. Such
originality and individuality! Suppose we let things slide
a little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well; we will not commit ourselves yet by saying
anything to Miss Nim&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Nimrod,&quot; announced Turple the magnificent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aha! Here we are again!&quot; cried Wee Winnie. &quot;How
are you, everybody? How is the old gentleman? Isn&#39;t
he here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is very well, thank you, but he is not one of us,&quot;
said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! Well, anyhow, I&#39;ve got another of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Sybil Hotspur?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The same. I found her raging like a volcano.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&mdash;smoking?&quot; queried Silverdale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, she is one of the old sort. She merely fumes,&quot;
said Wee Winnie, laughing as if she had made a joke.
&quot;She was raving against the infidelity of men. Poor Guy!
How his ears must have tingled. He has sent her a long
explanation, but she laughs it to scorn. I persuaded her
to let you see it&mdash;it is so quaint.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you it with you?&quot; asked Lillie eagerly. Her
appetite for tales of real life was growing by what it fed upon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;here is his letter, several quires long. But before
you can understand it, you must know how the breach
came about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord Silverdale, pass Miss Nimrod the chocolate
creams. Or would you like some lemonade?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lemonade by all means,&quot; replied Wee Winnie, taking
up her favorite attitude astride the sofa. &quot;With just a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
wee drappie of whiskey in it, if you please. I daresay I
shall be as dry as a lime-kiln before I&#39;ve finished the story
and read you this letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Turple the magnificent duly attended to Miss Nimrod&#39;s
wants. Whatever he felt, he made no sign. He was
simply Turple the magnificent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One fine day,&quot; said Wee Winnie, &quot;or rather, one day
that began fine, a merry party made an excursion into
the country. Sybil Hotspur and her <i>fiancé</i>, Guy Fledgely,
(and of course the baronet) were of the party. After
picknicking on the grass, the party broke up into twos till
tea-time. The baronet was good enough to pair off with
an unattached young lady, and so Sybil and Guy were
free to wander away into a copse. The sun was very hot,
and the young man had not spared the fizz. First he took
off his coat, to be cooler, then with an afterthought he
converted it into a pillow and went to sleep. Meantime
Sybil, under the protection of her parasol, steadily perused
one of Addiper&#39;s early works, chaster in style than in
substance, and sneering in exquisitely chiselled epigrams
at the weaknesses of his sex. Sybil stole an involuntary
glance at Guy&mdash;sleeping so peacefully like a babe in the
wood, with the squirrels peeping at him trustfully. She
felt that Addiper was a jaundiced cynic&mdash;that her Guy at
least would be faithful unto death. At that instant she
saw a folded sheet of paper on the ground near Guy&#39;s
shoulder. It might have slipped from the inner pocket
of the coat on which his head was resting, but if it had
she could not put it back without disturbing his slumbers.
Besides, it might not belong to him at all. She picked
up the paper, opened it, and turned pale as death. This is
what she read.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Manager of <i>Daily Hurrygraph</i>. Please insert enclosed
series, in order named, on alternate days, commencing
to-day week. Postal order enclosed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
&quot;&#39;1. Dearest, dearest, dearest. Remember the grotto.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Popsy.</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;2. Dearest, dearest, dearest. This is worse than
silence. Sobs are cheap to-day.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Popsy.</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;3. Dearest, dearest, dearest. Only Anastasia and
the dog. Thought I should have died. Cruel heart, hope
on. The white band of hope! Watchman, what of the
night? Shall we say 11.15 from Paddington since the
sea will not give up its dead? I have drained the dregs.
The rest is silence. Answer to-morrow or I shall dree
my weird.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Popsy.</span>&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was no signature to the letter, but the writing
was that which had hitherto borne to poor Sybil the daily
assurances of her lover&#39;s devotion. She looked at the
sleeping traitor so savagely that he moved uncomfortably,
even in his sleep. Like a serpent that scrap of paper
had entered into her Eden, and she put it in her bosom
that it might sting her. Unnoticed, the shadows had
been lengthening, the sky had grown gray, as if in harmony
with her blighted hopes. Roughly she roused the
sleeper, and hastily they wended their way back to the
rendezvous, to find tea just over and the rush to the
station just beginning. There was no time to talk till
they were seated face to face in the railway carriage.
The party had just caught the train, and bundling in anyhow
had become separated. Sybil and Guy were alone
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then Sybil plucked from her breast the serpent and
held it up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Guy,&#39; she said. &#39;What is this?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He turned pale. &#39;W&mdash;w&mdash;here did you get that from?&#39;
he stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;What is this?&#39; she repeated, and read in unsympathetic
accents: &#39;Dearest, dearest, dearest. Remember
the grotto.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Popsy.</span>&#39;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
&quot;&#39;Who is &quot;dearest&quot;?&#39; she continued.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;You, of course,&#39; he said with ghastly playfulness.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i248.jpg" width="600" height="598" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>&quot;Dearest, is you,&quot; he said with ghastly playfulness.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Indeed. Then allow me to say, sir, I <i>will</i> remember
the grotto. I shall never forget it, Popsy. If you wish
to communicate with me, a penny postage stamp is, I
believe, adequate. Perhaps I am also Anastasia, to say
nothing of the dog. Or shall we say the 11-15 from Paddington,
Popsy?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Sybil, darling,&#39; he broke in piteously. &#39;Give me
back that paper, you wouldn&#39;t understand.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sybil silently replaced the serpent in her bosom and
leant back haughtily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I can explain all,&#39; he cried wildly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I am listening,&#39; Sybil said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The fact is&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#39; The young man flushed and
stammered. Sybil&#39;s pursed lips gave him no assistance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;It may seem incredible&mdash;you will not believe it.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sybil made no sign.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I&mdash;I&mdash;am the victim of a disease.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sybil stared scornfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#39;t look at me like that, or I can&#39;t tell you.
I&mdash;I&mdash;I didn&#39;t like to tell you before, but I always knew
you would have to know some day. Perhaps it is better
it has come out before our marriage. Listen!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The young man leant over and breathed solemnly in
her ear: &#39;<i>I suffer from an hereditary tendency to advertise
in the agony column</i>.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sybil made no reply. The train drew up at a station.
Without a word Sybil left the carriage and rejoined her
friends in the next compartment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What an extraordinary excuse,&quot; exclaimed Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So Sybil thought,&quot; replied Wee Winnie. &quot;From that
day to this&mdash;almost a week&mdash;she has never spoken to
him. And yet Guy persists in his explanation, even to
me; which is so superfluous that I am almost inclined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
believe in its truth. At any rate I will now read you his
letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&#39;<span class="smcap">Dear Sybil</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Perhaps for the last time I address you thus, for if
after reading this you still refuse to believe me, I shall
not trespass upon your patience again. But for the sake
of our past love I beg you to read what follows in a trusting
spirit, and if not in a trusting spirit, at least to read
it. It is the story of how my father became a baronet,
and when you know that, you will perhaps learn to pity
and to bear with me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;When a young man my father was bitten by the passion
for contributing to the agony column. Some young men
spend their money in one way, some in another; this was
my father&#39;s dissipation. He loved to insert mysterious
words and sentences in the advertisement columns of the
newspapers, so as to enjoy the sensation of giving food for
speculation to a whole people. To sit quietly at home
and with a stroke of the pen influence the thoughts of
millions of his countrymen&mdash;this gave my father the
keenest satisfaction. When you come to analyze it, what
more does the greatest author do?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The agony column is the royal road to successful
authorship, if the publication of fiction in leading newspapers
be any test of success; for my father used sometimes
to conduct whole romances by correspondence,
after the fashion of the then reigning Wilkie Collins. And
the agony column is also the most innocuous method for
satisfying that crave for supplying topics of conversation
which sometimes leads people to crime. I make this
analysis to show you that there was no antecedent improbability
about what you seem to consider a wild excuse.
The desire to contribute to this department of journalism
is no isolated psychical freak; it is related to many other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
manifestations of mental activity, and is perfectly intelligible.
But this desire, like every other, may be given its
head till it runs away with the whole man. So it was with
my father. He began&mdash;half in fun&mdash;with a small advertisement,
one insertion. Unfortunately&mdash;or fortunately&mdash;he
made a little hit with it. He heard two men discussing
it in a café. The next week he tried again&mdash;unsuccessfully
this time, so far as he knew. But the third advertisement
was again a topic of conversation. Even in his
own office (he was training for an architect), he heard the
fellows saying, &quot;Did you see that funny advertisement this
morning&mdash;&#39;Be careful not to break the baby.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;You can imagine how intoxicating this sort of thing is
and how the craving for the secret enjoyment it brings
may grow on a man. Gradually my father became the
victim of a passion fiercer than the gambler&#39;s, yet akin to
it. For, he never knew whether his money would procure
him the gratification he yearned for or not; it was all a
fluke. The most promising mysteries would attract no
attention, and even a carefully planned novelette, that ran
for a week with as many as three characters intervening,
would fall still-born upon the tapis of conversation. But
every failure only spurred him to fresh effort. All his
spare coin, all his savings, went into the tills of the newspaper
cashiers. He cut down his expenses to the uttermost
farthing, living abstemiously and dressing almost
shabbily, and sacrificing everything to his ambitions. It
was lucky he was not in a bank; for he had only a
moderate income, and who knows to what he might have
been driven? At last my father struck oil. Tired of the
unfruitful field of romance, whose best days seemed to be
over, my father returned to that rudimentary literature
which pleases the widest number of readers, while it has the
never-failing charm of the primitive for the jaded disciples
of culture. He wrote only polysyllabic unintelligibilities.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
&quot;&#39;Thus for a whole week in every morning agony column
he published in large capitals the word:</p>

<p class="center">&quot;&#39;<i>Paddlepintospheroskedaddepoid.</i></p>

<p class="indent">This was an instantaneous success. But it was only a
<i>succès d&#39;estime</i>. People talked of it, but they could not
remember it. It had no seeds of permanence in it. It
could never be more than a nine days&#39; wonder. It was
an artificial, esoteric novelty, that might please the cliques
but could never touch the masses. It lacked the simplicity
of real greatness, that unmistakable elemental <i>cachet</i>
which commends things to the great heart of the people.
After a bit, this dawned upon my father; and, profiting
by his experience, he determined to create something
which should be immortal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;For days he racked his brains, unable to please himself.
He had the critical fastidiousness of the true artist, and
his ideal ever hovered before him, unseizable. Grotesque
words floated about him in abundance, every current
of air brought him new suggestions, he lived in a world of
strange sounds. But the great combination came not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Late one night, as he sat brooding by his dying fire,
there came a sudden rapping at his chamber door. A flash
of joy illumined his face, he started to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;I have it!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Have what?&quot; said his friend Marple, bursting into
the room without further parley.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Influenza,&quot; surlily answered my father, for he was not
to be caught napping, and Marple went away hurriedly.
Marple was something in the city. The two young men
were great friends, but there are some things which cannot
be told even to friends. It was not influenza my father
had got. To his fevered onomatop&oelig;ic fancy, Marple&#39;s
quick quadruple rap had translated itself into the word:
<span class="smcap">Olotutu</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
&quot;&#39;At this hour of the day, my dear Sybil, it is superfluous
to say anything about this word, with which you have been
familiar from your cradle. It has now been before the public
over a quarter of a century, and it has long since won
immortality. Little did you think when we sat in the railway
carriage yesterday, that the &quot;Olotutu&quot; that glared at
you from the partition was the far-away cause of the cloud
now hanging over our lives. But it may be interesting to
you to learn that in the early days many people put the
accent on the second syllable, whereas all the world now
knows, the accent is on the first, and the &quot;o&quot; of &quot;ol&quot; is
short. When my father found he had set the Thames on
fire, he was almost beside himself with joy. At the office
the clerks, in the intervals of wondering about &quot;Olotutu&quot;
wondered if he had come into a fortune. He determined
to follow up his success: to back the winning word, to
consecrate his life to &quot;Olotutu,&quot; to put all his money on it.
Thenceforwards for the next three months you very rarely
opened a paper without seeing the word, &quot;Olotutu.&quot; It
stood always by itself, self-complete and independent, rigid
and austere, in provoking sphynx-like solitude. Sybil,
imagine to yourself my father&#39;s rapture! To be the one
man in all England who had the clue to the enigma of
&quot;Olotutu!&quot; At last the burden of his secret became intolerable.
He felt he must breathe a hint of it or die.
One night while Marple was smoking in his rooms and
wondering about &quot;Olotutu,&quot; my father proudly told him
all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Great heavens!&quot; exclaimed Marple. &quot;Tip us your
flipper, old man! You are a millionaire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;A what?&quot; gasped my father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;A millionaire!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Are you a lunatic?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Are you an idiot? Don&#39;t you see that there is a
fortune in &#39;Olotutu&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
&quot;&#39;&quot;A fortune! How?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;By bringing it out as a Joint Stock Company.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;But&mdash;but&mdash;but you don&#39;t understand. &#39;Olotutu&#39;
is only&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Only an income for life,&quot; interrupted Marple excitedly.
&quot;Look here, old boy, I&#39;ll get you up a syndicate
to run it in twenty-four hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;No, I mean to do. I&#39;m an ass not to quietly annex
it all to myself, but I always said I was too honest for the
City. Give me &#39;Olotutu&#39; and we&#39;ll divide the profits.
Glory! Hooray!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;He capered about the floor wildly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;But what profits? Where from?&quot; asked my father,
still unenlightened, for, outside architecture, he was a
greenhorn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Marple sang the &quot;Ba, ba, ba, boodle-dee&quot; of the day,
and continued his wild career.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;My father seized him by the throat and pushed him
into a chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Speak, man,&quot; he cried agitatedly. &quot;Stop your tomfoolery
and talk sense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;I am talking cents&mdash;which is better,&quot; said Marple,
with a boisterous burst of laughter. &quot;A word that all the
world is talking about is a gold-mine&mdash;a real gold-mine. I
mean, not one on a prospectus. Don&#39;t you see that &#39;Olotutu&#39;
is a household word, and that everybody imagines it is
the name of some new patent, something which the proprietor
has been keeping dark? I did myself. When at last
&#39;Olotutu&#39; <i>is</i> put upon the market it will come into the world
under the fierce light that beats upon a boom, and it will
be snapped up like currant cake at a tea-fight. Why,
Nemo&#39;s Fruit Pepper, which has been on every hoarding
for twenty years, is not half so much talked about as &#39;Olotutu.&#39;
What you achieved is an immense preliminary advertisement&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
you were calmly thinking of stopping there!
Within sight of Pactolus!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;I had achieved <i>my</i> end!&quot; replied my father with dignity.
&quot;Art for art&#39;s sake&mdash;I did not work for money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Then you refuse half the profits?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Oh, no, no! If the artist&#39;s work brings him money,
he cannot help it. I think I catch your idea now. You
wish to put some commodity upon the market attached
to the name of &#39;Olotutu.&#39; We have a pedestal but no
statue, a cloak but nothing to cover.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;We shall have plenty to cover soon,&quot; observed Marple
winking. And he sat himself unceremoniously at my
writing-desk and began scribbling away for dear life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;I suppose then,&quot; went on my father, &quot;we shall have
to get hold of some article and manufacture it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Nonsense,&quot; jerked Marple. &quot;Where are we to get
the capital from?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Oh, I see you will get the syndicate to do it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Good gracious, man!&quot; yelped Marple. &quot;Do you
suppose the syndicate will have any capital? Let me
write in peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;But who <i>is</i> going to manufacture &#39;Olotutu&#39; then?&quot;
persisted my father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;The British Public of course,&quot; thundered Marple.
My father was silenced. The feverish scratching of Marple&#39;s
pen continued, working my father up to an indescribable
nervous tension.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;But what will &#39;Olotutu&#39; be?&quot; he inquired at last.
&quot;A patent medicine, a tobacco, a soap, a mine, a comic
paper, a beverage, a tooth-powder, a hair-restorer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Look here, old man!&quot; roared Marple. &quot;How do
you expect me to bother about details? This thing has
got to be worked at once. The best part of the Company
season is already over. But &#39;Olotutu&#39; is going to
make it up. Mark my words the shares of &#39;Olotutu&#39; will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
be at a premium on the day of issue. Another sheet of
paper, quick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;I want to write to a firm of Chartered Accountants
and Valuers to give an estimate of the profits!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;An estimate of the profits?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;Don&#39;t talk like a parrot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;But how can they estimate the profits?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&quot;How? what do you suppose they&#39;re chartered for?
You or I couldn&#39;t do it; of course not. But it&#39;s the business
of accountants! That&#39;s what they&#39;re for. Pass me
more writing-paper&mdash;reams of it!&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><i>The public curiosity amounted to frenzy.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Marple spent the whole of that night writing letters to
what he called his tame guinea-pigs; and the very next
day large bills bearing the solitary word &quot;Olotutu&quot; were
posted up all over London till the public curiosity mounted
to frenzy. The bill-posters earnt many a half-crown by
misinforming the inquisitive. Marple worked like a horse.
First he drew up the Prospectus, leaving blanks for the
Board of Directors of the Company. Then he filled up
the blanks. It was not easy. One lord was only induced
to serve on Marple&#39;s convincing representations of
the good &#39;Olotutu&#39; would do to the masses. When the
Board was complete, Marple had still to get the Syndicate
from which the Directors were to acquire &quot;Olotutu,&quot;
but he left this till the end, knowing there would be no
difficulty there. I have never been able to gather from
my father exactly what went on, nor does my father profess
to know exactly himself, but he tells with regret how
he used to worry Marple daily by inquiring if he had yet
decided what &quot;Olotutu&quot; was to be, as if Marple had not
his hands full enough without that. Marple turned round
on him one day and shrieked: &quot;That&#39;s your affair, not
mine. You&#39;re selling &#39;Olotutu&#39; to me, aren&#39;t you? I
can&#39;t be buyer and seller, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
&quot;&#39;This, by the way, does not seem to be as impossible as
it sounds for, according to my father, when the company
came out, Marple bought and sold &quot;Olotutu&quot; in the most
mysterious manner, rigging the market, watering the shares,
cornering the bears, and doing other extraordinary things,
each and all at a profit. He was not satisfied with his
share of the price paid for &quot;Olotutu&quot; by the syndicate,
nor with his share of the enormously higher price paid to
the syndicate by the public, but went in for Stock Exchange
man&oelig;uvres six-deep, coming out an easy winner
on settling day. One of my father&#39;s most treasured collections
is the complete set of proofs of the prospectus.
It went through thirteen editions before it reached the
public; no author could revise his book more lovingly
than Marple revised that prospectus. What tales printers
could tell to be sure! The most noticeable variations in
the text of my father&#39;s collection are the omission or
addition of cyphers. Some of the editions have £120,000
for the share capital of the Company, where others
have £1,200,000 and others £12,000. Sometimes the directors
appear to have extenuated &quot;nought,&quot; sometimes to
have set down &quot;nought&quot; in malice. As for the number of
debenture shares, the amounts to be paid up on allotment,
the contracts with divers obscure individuals, the number
of shares to be taken up by the directors and the number
to be accepted by the vendors in part payment, these
vary indefinitely; but in no edition, not even in those still
void of the names of the directors, do the profits guaranteed
by the directors fall below twenty-five per cent.
Sometimes the complex and brain-baffling calculations
that fill page three result in a bigger profit, sometimes in
a smaller, but they are always cheering to contemplate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;There is not very much about &quot;Olotutu&quot; itself even in
the last edition, but from the very first, there is a great deal
about the power of the company to manufacture, import,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
export, and deal in all kinds of materials, commodities, and
articles necessary for and useful in carrying on the same;
to carry on any other operations or business which the
company might from time to time deem expedient in connection
with its main business for the time being; to
purchase, take in exchange, or on lease, hire, or otherwise,
in any part of the world, for any estate, or interests,
any lands, factories, buildings, easements, patent rights,
brands and trademarks, concessions, privileges, machinery,
plant, stock-in-trade, utensils, necessary or convenient, for
the purposes of the company, or to sell, exchange, let
or rent royalty, share of profits, or otherwise use and grant
licenses, easements and other rights of and over, and in
any other manner deal with or dispose of the whole or any
part of the undertaking, business and property of the
Company, and in consideration to accept cash or shares,
stock, debenture or securities of any company whose
objects were or included objects similar to those of the
Company.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The actual nature of &quot;Olotutu&quot; does not seem to have
been settled till the ninth edition, but all the editions include
the analyst&#39;s report, certifying that &quot;Olotutu&quot; contains
no injurious ingredients and is far purer and safer
than any other (here there was a blank in the first eight
editions in the market). From this it is evident that
Marple has made up his mind to something chemical,
though it is equally apparent that he kept an open mind
regards its precise character, for in the ninth edition the
blank is filled up with &quot;purgative,&quot; in the tenth with &quot;meat
extract,&quot; in the eleventh with &quot;hair-dye,&quot; in the twelfth
with &quot;cod liver oil,&quot; and it is only in the thirteenth edition
that the final decision seems to have been arrived at in
favor of &quot;soap.&quot; This of course, my dear Sybil, you
already know. Indeed, if I mistake not, &quot;Olotutu,&quot; the
only absolutely scentless soap in the market, is your own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
pet soap. I hope it will not shock you too much if I tell
you in the strictest confidence that except in price, stamp,
and copious paper-wrapping, &quot;Olotutu&quot; is simply bars of
yellow soap chopped small. It was here, perhaps, that
Marple&#39;s genius showed to the highest advantage. The
public was overdone with patent scented soaps; there
seemed something unhealthy or at least molly-coddling
about their use; the time was ripe for return to the rude
and primitive. &quot;Absolutely scentless&quot; became the trademark
of &quot;Olotutu&quot; and the public, being absolutely
senseless (<i>pace</i>, my dear Sybil), somehow concluded that
because the soap was devoid of scent it was impregnated
with sanitation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Is there need to prolong the story? My father, so unexpectedly
enriched, abandoned architecture and married
almost immediately. Soon he became the idol of a popular
constituency, and, voting steadily with his party, was
made a baronet. I was born a few months after the first
dividend was announced. It was a dividend of thirty-three
per cent, for &quot;Olotutu&quot; had become an indispensable
adjunct to every toilet-table and the financial papers
published leaders, boasting of having put their clients up
to a good thing, and &quot;Olotutu&quot; was on everybody&#39;s tongue
and got into everybody&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Can you wonder, then, that I was born with a congenital
craving for springing mysteries upon the public? Can
you still disbelieve that I suffer from an hereditary tendency
to advertise in the agony column?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;At periodic intervals an irresistible prompting to force
uncouth words upon the universal consciousness seizes
me; at other times I am driven to beguile the public with
pseudo-sensational communications to imaginary personages.
It was fortunate my father early discovered my
penchant and told me the story of his life, for I think the
very knowledge that I am the victim of heredity helps me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
to defy my own instincts. No man likes to feel he is the
shuttlecock of blind forces. Still they are occasionally
too strong for me, and my present attack has been unusually
severe and protracted. I have been passing through
my father&#39;s early phases and conducting romances by correspondence.
Complimentary to the series of messages
signed Popsy, I had prepared a series signed Wopsy to go
in on alternate days, and if you had only continued your
search in my coat-pocket you would have discovered these
proofs of my innocence. May I trust it is now re-established,
and that &quot;Olotutu&quot; has washed away the apparent
stain on my character? With anxious heart I await your
reply.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;&#39;Ever yours devotedly,</p>

<p class="author">&quot;&#39;<span class="smcap">Guy</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sybil&#39;s reply was: &#39;I have read your letter. Do not
write to me again.&#39; She was so set against him,&quot; concluded
Miss Nimrod, &quot;she would not even write this but wired
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then she does not believe the story of how Guy
Fledgely&#39;s father became a baronet,&quot; said Lord Silverdale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She does not. She says &#39;Olotutu&#39; won&#39;t wash
stains.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I suppose you will be bringing her up,&quot; said the
President.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will&mdash;in the way she should go;&quot; answered Wee
Winnie. &quot;To-day is Saturday; I will bring her on Monday.
Meantime as it is getting very late, and as I have
finished my lemonade, I will bid you good afternoon&mdash;have
you used &#39;Olotutu?&#39;&quot; And with this facetious inquiry
Miss Nimrod twirled her stick and was off.</p>

<p class="indent">An hour later Lillie received a wire from Wee Winnie.</p>

&quot;<i>Olotutu. Wretches just reconciled. Letter follows.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And this was the letter that came by the first post on
Monday.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">My poor President</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have lost Sybil. She takes in the <i>Hurrygraph</i>
and reads the agony column religiously. So all the week
she has been exposed to a terrible bombardment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As thus (Tuesday.) &#39;My lost darling. A thousand
demons are knocking at my door. Say you forgive me or I
will let them in.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bobo.</span>&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or thus. (Wednesday.) &#39;My lost darling. You are
making a terrible mistake. I am innocent. I am writing
this on my bended knees. The fathers have eaten a
sour grape. Misericordia.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bobo.</span>&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The bitter cry of the outcast lover increased daily in
intensity, till on Saturday it became delirious.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;My lost darling. Save, O Save! I have opened the
door. They are there&mdash;in their thousands. The children&#39;s
teeth are set on edge. The grave is dug. Betwixt
two worlds I fall to the ground. Adieu forever.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bobo.</span>&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you believe that the poor little fool thought all
this was meant for her, and that in consequence she thawed
day by day till on Saturday she melted entirely and gushed
on Guy&#39;s shoulder? Guy admitted that he had inserted
these advertisements, but he did not tell her (as he afterwards
told me in confidence, and as I now tell you in confidence)
that they had been sent in before the quarrel occurred
and constituted his Agony Column romance for the
week, the Popsy Wopsy romance not being intended for
publication till next week. He had concocted these cries
of despairing passion without the least idea they would
so nearly cover his own case. But he says that as his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
hereditary craze got him into the scrape, it was only fair
his hereditary craze should get him out of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that&#39;s the end of Sybil Hotspur. But let us not
lament her too much. One so frail and fickle was not of
the stuff of which Old Maids are made. Courage! Wee

<p class="center">THE CLUB BECOMES POPULAR.</p>

<p class="indent">The influence of Wee Winnie on the war-path was
soon apparent. On the following Wednesday morning the
ante-room of the Club was as crowded with candidates as if
Lillie had advertised for a clerk with three tongues at ten
pounds a year. Silverdale had gone down to Fleet Street
to inquire if anything had been heard of Miss Ellaline
Rand&#39;s projected paper, and Lillie grappled with the applicants
single-handed.</p>

<p class="indent">Turple the magnificent, was told to usher them into the

that they were one, and as he could not tell which
one he gave way.</p>

and all the other pairs. But even the most trained eye
would be puzzled to detect any difference between these
two lovely young creatures. They were as like as two
peas or two cues, or the two gentlemen who mount and descend
together the mirror-lined staircase of a restaurant.
Interrogated as to the motives of their would-be renunciation,
one of them replied: &quot;My sister and myself are
twins. We were born so. When the news was announced to
our father, he is reported to have exclaimed, &#39;What a misfortune!&#39;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
His sympathy was not misplaced, for from our
nursery days upward our perfect resemblance to each other
has brought us perpetual annoyance. Do what we would,
we never could never get mistaken for each other. The
pleasing delusion that either of us would be saddled with
the misdeeds of the other has got us into scrapes without
number. At school we each played all sorts of pranks,
making sure the other would be punished for them. Alas!
the consequences have always recoiled on the head of the
guilty party. We were not even whipped for neglecting
each other&#39;s lessons. It was always for neglecting our
own. But in spite of the stern refusal of experience to
favor us with the usual imbroglio, we always went on
hoping that the luck would turn. We read Shakespeare&#39;s
<i>Comedy of Errors</i>, and that confirmed us in our evil courses.
When we grew up, it would be hard to say which was the
giddier, for each hoped that the other would have to bear
the burden of her escapades. You will have gathered
from our friskiness that our parents were strict Puritans,
but at last they allowed an eligible young curate to visit
the house with a view to matrimony. He was too good
for us; our parents were as much as we wanted in that
line. Unfortunately, in this crisis, unknown to each other,
the old temptation seized us. Each felt it a unique chance
of trying if the thing wouldn&#39;t work. When the other was
out of the room, each made love to the unwelcome suitor
so as to make him fall in love with her sister. Wretched
victims of mendacious farce-writers! The result was that
he fell in love with us both!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She paused a moment overcome with emotion, then resumed.
&quot;He proposed to us both simultaneously, vowed
he could not live without us. He exclaimed passionately
that he could not be happy with either were t&#39;other dear
charmer away. He said he was ready to become a Mormon
for love of us.&quot;</p>

&quot;And what was your reply?&quot; said Lillie anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">The fresh young voices broke out into a duet: &quot;We
told him to ask papa.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were both so overwhelmed by this catastrophe,&quot;
pursued the story-teller, &quot;that we vowed for mutual self-protection
against our besetting temptation to fribble at
the other&#39;s expense, never to let each other out of sight.
In the farces all the mistakes happen through the twins
being on only one at a time. Thus have we balanced
each other&#39;s tendencies to indiscretion before it was too
late, and saved ourselves from ourselves. This necessity
of being always together, imposed on us by our unhappy
resemblance, naturally excludes either from marriage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie was not favorably impressed with these skittish
sisters. &quot;I sympathize intensely with the sufferings of
either,&quot; she said slily, &quot;in being constrained to the society
of the other. But your motives of celibacy are not sufficiently
pure, nor have you fulfilled our prime condition,
for even granting that your reply to the eligible young
Churchman was tantamount to a rejection, it still only
amounts to a half rejection each, which is fifty per cent.
below our standard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She rang the bell. Turple the magnificent ushered the
twins out and the next candidate in. She was an ethereal
blonde in a simple white frock, and her story was as simple.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Read this Rondeau,&quot; she said. &quot;It will tell you all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie took the lines. They were headed</p>

<p class="center">THE LOVELY MAY&mdash;AN OLD MAID&#39;S PLAINT.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The lovely May at last is here,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Long summer days are drawing near,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And nights with cloudless moonshine rich;</span><br />
<span class="i2">In woodlands green, on waters clear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Soft-couched in fern, or on the mere,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Gliding like some white water-witch,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
<span class="i0">Or lunching in a leafy niche,</span><br />
<span class="i2">I see my sweet-faced sister dear,</span><br />
<span class="i4">The lovely May.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>She</i> is engaged&mdash;and her career</span><br />
<span class="i2">Is one of skittles blent with beer,</span><br />
<span class="i0">While I, plain sewing left to stitch,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Can ne&#39;er expect those pleasures which,</span><br />
<span class="i0">At this bright season of the year,</span><br />
<span class="i4">The lovely may.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Lillie looked up interrogatively. &quot;But surely <i>you</i> have
nothing to complain of in the way of loveliness?&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, of course not. <i>I am</i> the lovely May. It was my
sister who wrote that. She died in June and I found it
among her manuscripts. Remorse set in at the thought
of Maria stitching while I was otherwise engaged. I disengaged
myself at once. What&#39;s fair for one is fair for
all. Women should combine. While there&#39;s one woman
who can&#39;t get a husband, no man should be allowed to get
a wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hear, hear!&quot; cried Lillie enthusiastically. &quot;Only I
am afraid there will always be blacklegs among us who
will betray their sex for the sake of a husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alas, yes,&quot; agreed the lovely May. &quot;I fear such was
the nature of my sister Maria. She coveted even my first
husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; gasped the President. &quot;Are you a widow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly! I left off black when I was engaged again,
and when I was disengaged I dared not resume it for fear
of seeming to mourn my <i>fiancé</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We cannot have widows in the Old Maids&#39; Club,&quot;
said Lillie regretfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall start a new Widows&#39; Club and Old Maids
shall have no place in it.&quot; And the lovely May sailed out,
all smiles and tears.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
The newcomer was a most divinely tall and most divinely
fair brunette with a brooding, morbid expression. Candidate
gave the name of Miss Summerson.</p>

<p class="indent">Being invited to make a statement, she said: &quot;I have
abandoned the idea of marrying. I have no money. Ergo,
I cannot afford to marry a poor man. And I am resolved
never to marry a rich one. I want to be loved
for myself, not for my want of money. You may stare,
but I know what I am talking about. What other attraction
have I? Good looks? Plenty of girls with money
have that, who would be glad to marry the men I have rejected.
In the town I came from I lived with my cousin,
who was an heiress. She was far lovelier than I. Yet all
the moneyed men were at my feet. They were afraid of
being suspected of fortune-hunting and anxious to vindicate
their elevation of character. Why should I marry to
gratify a man&#39;s vanity, his cravings after cheap quixotism?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your attitude on the great question of the age does you
infinite credit, but as you have no banking account to put
it to, you traverse the regulation requiring a property qualification,&quot;
said the President.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there no way over the difficulty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear not: unless you marry a rich man, and that
disqualifies you under another rule.&quot; And Miss Summerson
passed sadly into the outer darkness, to be replaced
by a young lady who gave the name of Nell Lightfoot.
She wore a charming hat and a smile like the spreading
of sunshine over a crystal pool. &quot;I met a young Scotchman,&quot;
she said, &quot;at a New Year&#39;s dance, and we were
favorably impressed by each other. On the fourteenth
of the following February I received from him a Valentine,
containing a proposal of marriage and a revelation of the
degradation of masculine nature. It would seem he had
two strings to his bow&mdash;the other being a rich widow whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
he had met in a Devonshire lane. Being a Scotchman he
had for economy&#39;s sake composed a Valentine which with
a few slight alterations would do for both of us. Unfortunately
for himself he sent me the original draft by mistake
and here is his</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How strange!&quot; said Lillie. &quot;You combine the disqualifications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
of two of the previous candidates. You are
apparently poor and you have received only half a proposal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A flaming blonde, whose brow was crowned with an aurora
of auburn hair, was the next to burst upon the epigrammatic
scene. She spoke English with an excellent Parisian
accent. &quot;One has called me a young woman in a hurry,&quot;
she said, &quot;and the description does not want of truth. I
am impatient; I have large ideas; I am ambitious. If
I were a grocer I should contract for the Sahara. I fall
in love, and when Alice Leroux falls in love it is like the
volcano which goes to make eruption. Figure to yourself
that my man is shy&mdash;but of a shyness of the most
ridiculous&mdash;that it is necessary to make a thousand sweet
eyes at him before he comprehends that he loves me.
And when he comprehends it, he does not speak. <i>Mon
Dieu</i>, he does not speak, though I speak, me, with fan, my
eyes, my fingers, almost with my lips. He walks with me&mdash;but
he does not speak. He takes me to the spectacle&mdash;but
he does not speak. He promenades himself in boat
with me&mdash;but he does not speak. I encircle him with my
arms, and I speak with my lips at last&mdash;one, two, three,
four, five, kisses. Overwhelmed, astonished, he returns
me my kisses&mdash;hesitatingly, stupidly, but in fine, he
returns them And then at last&mdash;with our faces together,
my arm round his graceful waist&mdash;he speaks. The first
words of love comes from his mouth&mdash;and what think you
that he say? Say then.&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><i>I encircle him with my arms and speak with my lips.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love you?&quot; murmured Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A thousand thunders! No! He says: &#39;Miss Leroux&mdash;Alice;
may I call you Alice?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see nothing to wonder at in that,&quot; replied Lillie
quietly. &quot;Remember that for a man to kiss you is a less
serious step than for him to call you Alice. That were a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
stage on the road to marriage, and should only be reached
through the gate of betrothal. Changes of name are the
outward marks of a woman&#39;s development as much as
changes of form accompany the growth of the caterpillar.
You, for instance, began life as Alice. In due course you
became Miss Alice; if you were the eldest daughter you
became Miss Leroux at once; if you were not, you
inherited the name only on your sister&#39;s death or marriage;
when you are betrothed you will revert to the
simple Alice, and when you are married you will become
Mrs. Something Else; and every time you get married, if
you are careful to select husbands of varying patronymics,
you will be furnished with a change of name as well as
of address. Providence, which has conferred so many
sufferings upon woman, has given her this one advantage
over man, who in the majority of instance is doomed to
the monotony of ossified nomenclature, and has to wear
the same name on his tombstone which he wore on his
Eton collar.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is all a heap of galimatias,&quot; replied the Parisienne
with the flaming hair &quot;If I kiss a man, I, surely
he may call me Alice without demanding it? Bah! Let
him love your misses with <i>eau sucrée</i> in their veins.
When he insulted me with his stupidity, I became furious.
I threw him&mdash;how you say?&mdash;overboard on the instant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; gasped Lillie. &quot;Then you are a
murderess!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Figure you to yourself that I speak at the foot of the
letter? Know you not the idioms of your own barbarian
tongue? It seems to me you are as mad as he. Perhaps
you are his sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Our rules require us to regard all men as
brothers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>He!</i> What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
&quot;We have rejected the love of all men; consequently
we have to regard them all as our brothers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That man there my brother!&quot; shrieked Alice.
&quot;Never! Never of my life! I would rather marry
first!&quot; And she went off to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">The last of these competitors for the Old Maiden
Stakes was a whirlwind in petticoats who welcomed the
President very affably. &quot;Good-morning, Miss Dulcimer,&quot;
she said. &quot;I&#39;ve heard of you. I&#39;m from Boston way.
You know I travel about the world in search of culture.
I&#39;m spending the day in Europe, so I thought I&#39;d look you
up. Would you be so good as to epitomize your scheme
in twenty words? I&#39;ve got to see the Madonna del Cardellino
in the Uffizi at Florence before ten to-morrow, and
I want to hear an act of the <i>Meistersingers</i> at Bayreuth
after tea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m rather tired,&quot; pleaded Lillie, overwhelmed by
the dynamic energy radiating from every square inch of
the Bostonian&#39;s superficies. &quot;I have had a hard morning&#39;s
work. Couldn&#39;t you call again to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Impossible. I have just wired to Damietta to secure
rooms commanding a view of Professor Tickledroppe&#39;s
excavations on the banks of the Nile. I dote on archæological
treasures and thought I should like to see the Old
Maids. Are they on view?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, they are not here,&quot; said Lillie evasively. &quot;But
do you want to join us?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I have time? I remember I once wasted a
week getting married. Some women waste their whole
lives that way. Marriage is an incident of life&#39;s novel&mdash;they
make it the whole plot. I don&#39;t say it isn&#39;t an interesting
experience. Every woman ought to go through
it once, but with the infinite possibilities of culture lying
all round us it&#39;s mere Philistinism to give one husbandman
more than a week of your society. Mine is a physician
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
practising in Philadelphia. Judging by the checks he
sends me he must be a successful man. Well, I am real
glad to have had this little talk with you, it&#39;s been so interesting.
I will become an Honorary Member of your
charming Club with pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot if you are married. You can only be a
visitor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s my being married got to do with it?&quot; inquired
the American in astonishment. &quot;This is the first time I
have ever heard that the name of a club has anything to do
with the membership. Are the members of the Savage
Club savages, of the Garrick Garricks, of the Supper Club
suppers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are not men,&quot; Lillie said haughtily. &quot;I could
pass over your relation to the hub of the universe, but
when it comes to having a private hub I have no option.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, this may be your English idea of hospitality to
travellers of culture,&quot; replied the Bostonian warmly, &quot;but
if you come to our crack Crank Club in the fall you shall
be as welcome as a brand new poet. Good-bye. Hope
we shall meet again. I shall be in Hong Kong in June
if you like to drop in. Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Lillie, pressing one hand against the
visitor&#39;s and the other to her aching forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">Silverdale found her dissolved in tears. &quot;In future,&quot;
he said, when she had explained her troubles, &quot;I shall
hang the rules and by-laws in the waiting room. The candidates
will then be able to eliminate themselves. By
the way, Ellaline Rand&#39;s <i>Cherub</i> is going to sit up aloft,&mdash;on
a third floor in Fleet Street.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="center">A MUSICAL BAR.</p>

<p class="indent">When Turple the magnificent, looking uneasy, brought
up Frank Maddox&#39;s card, Lillie uttered a cry of surprise
and pleasure. Frank Maddox was a magic name to her
as to all the elect of the world of sweetness and light.
After a moment of nervous anxiety lest it should not be
<i>the</i> Frank Maddox, her fears were dispelled by the entry
of the great authority on art and music, whose face was
familiar to her from frontispiece portraits. Few critics
possessed such charms of style and feature as Frank
Maddox, who had a delicious <i>retroussé</i> nose, a dainty rosebud
mouth, blue eyes, and a wealth of golden hair.</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie&#39;s best hopes were confirmed. The famous critic
wished to become an Old Maid. The President and the
new and promising candidate had a delightful chat over a
cup of tea and the prospects of the Club. The two girls
speedily became friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if you join us, hadn&#39;t you better go back to your
maiden name?&quot; inquired Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps so,&quot; said Frank Maddox thoughtfully. &quot;My
pen-name does sound odd under the peculiar circumstances.
On the other hand to revert to Laura Spragg
now might be indiscreet. People would couple my name
with Frank Maddox&#39;s&mdash;you know the way of the world.
The gossips get their facts so distorted, and I couldn&#39;t
even deny the connection.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
&quot;But of course you <i>have</i> had your romance?&quot; asked
Lillie. &quot;You know one romance per head is our charge
for admission?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes! I have had my romance. In three vols.
Shall I tell it you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen, then. Volume the First: Frank Maddox is in
her study. Outside the sun is setting in furrows of gold-laced
sagging storm-clouds, dun and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, please, I always skip that,&quot; laughed Lillie. &quot;I
know that two lovers cannot walk in a lane without the
author seeing the sunset, which is the last thing in the
world the lovers see. But when the sky begins to look
black, I always begin to skip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive me. I didn&#39;t mean to do it. Remember I&#39;m
an habitual art-critic. I thought I was describing a
harmony of Whistler&#39;s or a movement from a sonata. It
shall not occur again. To the heroine enter the hero&mdash;shabby,
close-cropped, pale. Their eyes meet. He is
thunderstruck to find the heroine a woman; blushes,
stammers, and offers to go away. Struck by something
of innate refinement in his manner, she presses him to
avow the object of his visit. At last, in dignified language,
infinitely touching in its reticence, he confesses he
called on Mr. Frank Maddox, the writer he admires so
much, to ask a little pecuniary help. He is starving.
Original, isn&#39;t it, to have your hero hungry in the first
chapter? He speaks vaguely of having ambitions which,
unless he goes under in the struggle for existence may
some day be realized. There are so many men in London
like that. However, the heroine is moved by his destitute
condition and sitting down to her desk, she writes out
a note, folds it up and gives it to him. &#39;There!&#39; she says,
&#39;there&#39;s a prescription against starvation.&#39; &#39;But how am
I to take it?&#39; he asked. &#39;It must be taken before breakfast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
the first thing in the morning,&#39; she replied, &#39;to the
editor of the <i>Moon</i>. Give him the note; he will change it
for you. Don&#39;t mention my name.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He thanked me and withdrew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what was in the note?&quot; asked Lillie curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t quite remember. But something of this sort.
&#39;The numerous admirers of Frank Maddox will be gratified
to hear that she has in the press a volume of essays
on the part played by color-blindness in the symphonic
movements of the time. The great critic is still in town
but leaves for Torquay next Tuesday.&#39; For that the
editor of the <i>Moon</i> gave him half-a-crown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you call that charity?&quot; said Lillie, astonished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Charity begins at home. Do many people
give charity except to advertise themselves? Philanthropy
by paragraph is a perquisite of fame. Why, I have
a pensioner who comes in for all my <i>Acadæum</i> paragraphs.
That <i>Moon</i> part saved our hero from starvation. Years
afterwards I learnt he had frittered away two-pence in
having his hair cut.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems strange for a starving man to get his hair
cut,&quot; said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not when you know the cause,&quot; replied Frank
Maddox. &quot;It was his way of disguising himself. And
this brings me to Volume Two. The years pass. Once
again I am in my study. There is a breath of wind
among the elms in the front garden, and the sky is strewn
with vaporous sprays of apple-blossom&mdash;&mdash;I beg your pardon.
Re-enter the hero, spruce, frock-coated, dignified.
He recalls himself to my memory&mdash;but I remember him
only too well. He tells me that my half-crown saved him
at the turning-point of his career, that he has now achieved
fame and gold, that he loves my writing more passionately
than ever, and that he has come to ask me to crown his
life. The whole thing is so romantic that I am about to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
whisper &#39;yes&#39; when an instinct of common sense comes
to my aid and my half-opened lips murmur instead: &#39;But
the name you sent up&mdash;Horace Paul&mdash;it is not known to
me. You say you have won fame. I, at least, have never
heard of you.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Of course not,&#39; he replies. &#39;How should you? If
I were Horace Paul you would not marry me; just as I
should certainly not marry you if you were Frank Maddox.
But what of Paul Horace?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Paul Horace,&quot; cried Lillie. &quot;The great composer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is just what I exclaimed. And my hero answers:
&#39;The composer, great or little. None but a few
intimates connect me with him. The change of name
is too simple. I always had a longing&mdash;call it morbid if
you will&mdash;for obscurity in the midst of renown. I have
weekly harvests of hair to escape any suspicion of musical
attainments. But you and I, dearest&mdash;think of what
our life will be enriched by our common love of the noblest
of the arts. Outside, the marigolds nod to the violets,
the sapphire&mdash;excuse me, I mean to say&mdash;&mdash;&#39; thus he rambled
on, growing in enthusiasm with every ardent phrase,
the while a deadly coldness was fastening round my heart.
For I felt that it could not be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why?&quot; inquired Lillie in astonishment. &quot;It
seems one of the marriages made in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dared not tell him why; and I can only tell you on
condition you promise to keep my secret.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I promise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen,&quot; whispered the great critic. &quot;I know nothing
about music or art, and I was afraid he would find me
out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie fell back in her chair, white and trembling. Another
idol shivered! &quot;But how&mdash;&mdash;?&quot; she gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, then, don&#39;t take on so,&quot; said the great critic
kindly. &quot;I did not think you, too, were such an admirer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
mine, else I might have spared you the shock. You ask
how it is done. Well, I didn&#39;t set out to criticise. I can
at least plead that in extenuation. My nature is not wilfully
perverse. There was a time when I was as pure and
above criticism as yourself.&quot; She paused and furtively
wiped away a tear, then resumed more calmly, &quot;I
drifted into it. For years I toiled on, without ever a
thought of musical and art criticism sullying my maiden
meditations. My downfall was gradual. In early maidenhood
I earnt my living as a type-writer. I had always
had literary yearnings, but the hard facts of life allowed
me only this rough approximation to my ideal. Accident
brought excellent literature to my machine, and it required
all my native honesty not to steal the plots of the novelists
and the good things of the playwrights. The latter
was the harder temptation to resist, for when the play
was good enough to be worth stealing from, I knew it
would never be produced and my crime never discovered.
Still in spite of my honesty, I benefited indirectly by my
type-writing, for contact with so much admirable work
fostered the graceful literary style which, between you
and me, is my only merit. In time I plucked up courage
to ask one of my clients, a journalist, if he could put some
newspaper work in my way. &#39;What can you do?&#39; he
asked in surprise. &#39;Anything,&#39; I replied with maiden
modesty. &#39;I see, that&#39;s your special line,&#39; he said musingly.
&#39;Unfortunately we are full up in that department.
You see, everyone turns his hand to that&mdash;it&#39;s like schoolmastering,
the first thing people think of. It&#39;s a pity you
are a girl, because the way to journalistic distinction lies
through the position of office-boy. Office-girl sounds
strange. I doubt whether they would have you except
on a Freethought organ. Our office-boy has to sweep out
the office and review the novels, else you might commence
humbly as a critic of literature. It isn&#39;t a bad post either,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
for he supplements his income by picking rejected matter
out of the waste paper basket and surreptitiously lodging it
in the printer&#39;s copy pigeonhole. His income in fees from
journalistic aspirants must be considerable. Yes, had you
been a boy you might have made a pretty good thing out
of literature! Then there is no chance at all for me on
your paper?&#39; I inquired desperately. &#39;None,&#39; he said
sadly. &#39;Our editor is an awful old fogey. He is vehemently
opposed to the work of outsiders, and if you were to send
him his own leaders in envelopes he would say they were
rot. For once he would be a just critic. You see, therefore,
what your own chance is. Even I, who have been
on the staff for years, couldn&#39;t do anything to help you.
No, I am afraid there is no hope for you unless you
approach our office-boy.&#39; I thanked him warmly for his
advice and encouragement, and within a fortnight an
article of mine appeared in the paper. It was called
&#39;The Manuscripts of Authors,&#39; and revealed in a refined
and ladylike way the secrets of the chirographic characteristics
of the manuscripts I had to type-write. My friend
said I was exceedingly practical&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exceedingly practical,&quot; agreed Lillie with a suspicion
of a sneer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because most amateur journalists write about abstract
principles, whereas I had sliced out for the public a bit of
concrete fact, and the great heart of the people went out
to hear the details of the way Brown wrote his books,
Jones his jokes, and Robinson his recitations. The article
made a hit, and annoyed the authors very much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So, I should think,&quot; said Lillie. &quot;Didn&#39;t they withdraw
their custom from you instanter?&quot;</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>The office boy edits the paper.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why? They didn&#39;t know it was I. Only my journalistic
friend knew; and he was too much of a gentleman to
give away my secret. I wrote to the editor under the
name of Frank Maddox, thanking him for having inserted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
my article, and the editor said to my friend, &#39;Egad, I fancy
I&#39;ve made a discovery there. Why, if I were to pay any
attention to your idea of keeping strictly to the old
grooves, the paper would stagnate, my boy, simply
stagnate.&#39; The editor was right, for my friend assured
me the paper would have died long before, if the office-boy
had not condescended to edit it. Anyhow, it was to
that office-boy I owed my introduction to literature. The
editor was very proud of having discovered me, and, being
installed in his good graces, I passed rapidly into
dramatic criticism, and was even allowed to understudy
the office-boy as literary reviewer. He could not stomach
historical novels, and handed over to me all works with
pronouns in the second person. Gradually I rose to
higher things, but it was not until I had been musical and
art critic for over eighteen months that the editor learnt
that the writer whose virile style he had often dilated
upon to my friend was a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what did he do when he learnt it?&quot; asked Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He swore&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Profane man!&quot; cried Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That he loved me&mdash;me whom he had never seen. Of
course, I declined him with thanks; happily there was a
valid excuse, because he had written his communication
on both sides of the paper. But even this technical touch
did not mollify him, and he replied that my failure to
appreciate him showed I could no longer be trusted as a
critic. Fortunately my work had been signed, my fame
was established. I collected my articles into a book and
joined another paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you haven&#39;t yet told me how it is done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that is the least. You see, to be a critic it is not
essential to know anything&mdash;you must simply be able to
write. To be a great critic you must simply be able to write
<i>well</i>. In my omniscience, or catholic ignorance, I naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
looked about for the subject on which I could most
profitably employ my gift of style with the least chance
of being found out. A moment&#39;s consideration will convince
you that the most difficult branches of criticism are
the easiest. Of musical and artistic matters not one person
in a thousand understands aught but the rudiments: here,
then, is the field in which the critical ignoramus may
expatiate at large with the minimum danger of discovery.
Nay, with no scintilla of danger; for the subject matter is
so obscure and abstruse that the grossest of errors may
put on a bold face and parade as a profundity, or, driven
to bay, proclaim itself a paradox. Only say what you
have not got to say authoritatively and well, and the world
shall fall down and worship you. The place of art in
religion has undergone a peculiar historical development.
First men worshipped the object of art; then they worshipped
the artist; and nowadays they worship the art
critic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is true,&quot; said Lillie reflectively. &quot;This age has
witnessed the apotheosis of the art critic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And of all critics. And yet what can be more evident
than that the art of criticism was never in such a critical
condition? Nobody asks to see the critic&#39;s credentials.
He is taken at his own valuation. There ought to be an
examination to protect the public. Even schoolmasters
are now required to have certificates; while those who
pretend to train the larger mind in the way it should think
are left to work their mischief uncontrolled. No dramatic
critic should be allowed to practise without an elementary
knowledge of human life, law, Shakespeare, and French.
The musical critic should be required to be able to perform
on some one instrument other than his own trumpet,
to distinguish tune from tonality, to construe the regular
sonata, to comprehend the plot of <i>Il Trovatore</i>, and to
understand the motives of Wagner. The art critic should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
be able to discriminate between a pastel and a water-color,
an impressionist drawing and a rough sketch, to
know the Dutch school from the Italian, and the female
figure from the male, to translate morbidezza and chiaroscuro,
and failing this, to be aware of the existence and
uses of a vanishing point. A doctor&#39;s certificate should
also be produced to testify that the examinee is in possession
of all the normal faculties; deafness, blindness,
and color-blindness being regarded as disqualifications,
and no one should be allowed to practise unless he
enjoyed a character for common honesty supplemented
by a testimonial from a clergyman, for although art is
non-moral the critic should be moral. This would be
merely the passman stage; there could always be examinations
in honors for the graduates. Once the art critics
were educated, the progress of the public would be rapid.
They would no longer be ready to admire the canvases of
Michael Angelo, who, as I learnt the other day for the
first time, painted frescoes, nor would they prefer him, as
unhesitatingly as they do now, to Buonarotti, which is his
surname, nor would they imagine Raffaelle&#39;s Cartoons
appeared in <i>Puncinello</i>. All these mistakes I have myself
made, though no one discovered them; while in the realm
of music no one has more misrepresented the masters,
more discouraged the overtures of young composers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But still I do not understand how it is done,&quot; urged
Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall have my formula in a nutshell. I had to
be a musical critic and an art critic. I was ignorant of
music and knew nothing of art. But I was a dab at
language. When I was talking of music, I used the
nomenclature of art. I spoke of light and shade, color
and form, delicacy of outline, depth and atmosphere, perspective,
foreground and background, nocturnes and
harmonies in blue. I analyzed symphonies pictorially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
and explained what I saw defiling before me as the music
swept on. Sunsets and belvedere towers, swarthy Paynims
on Shetland ponies, cypress plumes and Fra Angelico&#39;s
cherubs, lumps of green clay and delicate pillared loggias,
fennel tufts and rococo and scarlet anemones, and over
all the trail of the serpent. Thus I created an epoch in
musical criticism. On the other hand, when I had to deal
with art, I was careful to eschew every suggestion of the
visual vocabulary and to confine myself to musical phrases.
In talking of pictures, I dwelt upon their counter-point
and their orchestration, their changes of key and the
evolution of their ideas, their piano and forte-passages, and
their bars of rest, their allegro and diminuendo aspects,
their suspensions on the dominant. I spoke of them as
symphonies and sonatas and masses, said one was too
staccato and another too full of consecutive sevenths,
and a third in need of transposition to the minor. Thus
I created an epoch in art criticism. In both departments
the vague and shifting terms I introduced enabled me to
evade mistakes and avoid detection, while the creation
of two epochs gave me the very first place in contemporary
criticism. There is nothing in which I would not undertake
to create an epoch. I do not say I have always been
happy, and it has been a source of constant regret to me
that I had not even learnt to play the piano when a girl
and that unplayed music still remained to me little black
dots.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so you did not dare marry the composer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, nor tell him why. Volume Three: I said I admired
him so much that I wanted to go on devoting critical
essays to him, and my praises would be discounted by the
public if I were his wife. Was it not imprudent for him
to alienate the leading critic by marrying her? Rather
would I sacrifice myself and continue to criticise him. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
I love him, and it is for his sake I would become an Old
Maid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would rather you didn&#39;t,&quot; said Lillie, her face still
white. &quot;I have found so much inspiration in your books
that I could not bear to be daily reminded I ought not to
have found it.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE BEAUTIFUL GHOUL.</p>

<p class="indent">Wee Winnie called at the Club, while the President
was still under the cloud of depression, and Lillie had to
force herself to look cheerful, lest Miss Nimrod should
mistake the melancholy, engendered by so many revelations
of the seamy side of life, for loss of faith in the Club
or its prospects.</p>

<p class="indent">Avid of experience as was the introspective little girl,
she felt almost fated for the present.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Nimrod was astonished to hear of the number of
rejections, and to learn that she had whipped up the
Writers, and the Junior Widows, and her private friends
to such little purpose. But in the end she agreed with
Lillie that, as no doubt somewhere or other in the wide
universe ideal Old Maids were blooming and breathing,
it would be folly to clog themselves up in advance with
inferior specimens.</p>

<p class="indent">The millionaire, who was pottering about in blue spectacles,
strolled into the club while Wee Winnie was uttering
magnificent rhapsodies about the pages the Club
would occupy in the histories of England, but this time
Lillie was determined the dignity of the by-laws should
be maintained, and had her father shown out by Turple
the magnificent. Miss Nimrod went, too, and so Lord
Silverdale had the pleasure of finding Lillie alone.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
&quot;You ought to present me with a pair of white gloves,&quot;
he said, gleefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t had a single candidate to try for days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Lillie with a suspicion of weariness in her
voice. &quot;They all broke down in the elementary stage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even as she spoke Turple the magnificent ushered in
Miss Margaret Linbridge. Lord Silverdale, doubly vexed
at having been a little too previous in the counting of his
chickens, took up his hat to go, but Lillie murmured:
&quot;Please amuse yourself in the library for a quarter of an
hour, as I may want you to do the trying at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you expect me to amuse myself in the library?&quot;
he grumbled. &quot;You don&#39;t keep one of my books.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Margaret Linbridge&#39;s story was simple, almost
commonplace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had spent Christmas with a married sister in Plymouth,&quot;
she said, &quot;and was returning to London by the
express on the first of January. My prospects for the
New Year were bright&mdash;or seemed so to my then unsophisticated
eyes. I was engaged to be married to Richard
Westbourne&mdash;a good and good-looking young man, not
devoid of pecuniary attractions. My brother, with whom
I lived and on whom I was dependent, was a struggling
young firework-manufacturer, and would, I knew, be glad
to see me married, even if it cost him a portion of his
stock to express his joy. The little seaside holiday had
made me look my prettiest, and when my brother-in-law
saw me into a first-class carriage and left me with a fraternally-legal
kiss, I rather pitied him for having to go
back to my sister. There was only one other person in
the carriage beside myself&mdash;a stern old gentleman, who
sat crumpled up in the opposite corner and read a paper
steadily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The train flew along the white frosty landscape at express
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
rates, but the old gentleman never looked up from
his paper. The temperature was chill and I coughed.
The old gentleman evinced no symptom of sympathy. I
rolled up my veil the better to see the curmudgeon, and
smiled to think what a fool he was, but he betrayed no
sign of sharing my amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At last, as he was turning his page, I said in my most
dulcet tones: &#39;Oh, pray excuse my appropriating the entire
foot-warmer. I don&#39;t know why there is only one,
but I will share it with you with pleasure.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Thank you,&#39; he said gruffly, &#39;I&#39;m not cold.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oh, aren&#39;t you!&#39; I murmured inwardly, adding aloud
with a severe wintry tone, &#39;Gentlemen of your age usually
are.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes, but I&#39;m not a gentleman of my age,&#39; he growled,
mistaking the imbecile statement for repartee.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I beg your pardon,&#39; said I. &#39;I was judging by appearances.
Is that the <i>Saturday Slasher</i> you have there?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He shook himself impatiently. &#39;No, it is not.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I beg your pardon,&#39; said I. &#39;I was again judging by
appearances. May I ask what it is?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;<i>Threepenny Bits!</i>&#39; he jerked back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;What&#39;s that?&#39; I asked. &#39;I know <i>Broken Bits</i>.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;This is a superior edition of <i>Broken Bits</i> at the price
indicated by the title. It contains the same matter, but
is issued at a price adapted to the means of the moneyed
and intellectual classes. No self-respecting person can
be seen reading penny weeklies&mdash;it throws doubt not only
on his income, but on his mental calibre. The idea of
this first-class edition (so to speak) should make the fortune
of the proprietor, and deservedly so. Of course, the
thousand pound railway assurance scheme is likewise
trebled, though this part of the paper does not attract
me personally, for my next-of-kin is a hypocritical young
rogue. But imagine the horror of being found dead with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
a penny weekly in one&#39;s pocket! You can&#39;t even explain
it away.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He had hardly finished the sentence before a terrible
shock, as of a ton of dynamite exploding under the foot-warmer,
lifted me into the air; the carriage collapsed like
matchwood, and I had the feeling of being thrown into
the next world. For a moment I recovered a gleam of
consciousness, just enough to show me I was lying dying
amid the <i>débris</i>, and that my companion lay, already dead,
in a fragment of the compartment, <i>Threepenny Bits</i> clenched
in his lifeless hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With a last fond touch I smoothed my hair, which
had got rather ruffled in the catastrophe, and extracting
with infinite agony a puff from my pocket I dabbed it
spasmodically over my face. I dared not consult my
hand-mirror, I was afraid it would reveal a distorted countenance
and unnecessarily sadden my last moments.
Whatever my appearance, I had done my best for it, and
I wanted to die with the consciousness of duty fulfilled.
Murmuring a prayer that those who found my body would
not imitate me in judging by appearances, if they should
prove discreditable after all, I closed my eyes upon the
world in which I had been so young and happy. My
whole life passed in review before me, all my dearly loved
bonnets, my entire wardrobe from infancy upwards. Now
I was an innocent child with a white sash and pink ribbons,
straying amid the sunny meadows and plucking the
daisies to adorn my hats; anon a merry maiden sporting
amid the jocund schoolboys and receiving tribute in toffy;
then again a sedate virgin in original gowns and tailor-made
jackets. Suddenly a strange idea jostled through
the throng of bitter-sweet memories. <i>Threepenny
Bits!</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old gentleman&#39;s next-of-kin would come in for
three thousand pounds! I should die and leave nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
to my relatives but regrets; my generous brother would
be forever inconsolable now, and my funeral might be
mean and unworthy. And yet if the old misogynist had
only been courteous enough to lend me the paper, seeing
I had nothing to read, it might have been found on my
body. <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum.</i> Why reveal his breach
of etiquette to the world? Why should I not enable him
to achieve posthumous politeness! Besides, his heir was
a hypocritical rogue, and it were a crime against society
to place so large a sum at his disposal. Overwhelmed as
I was by the agonies of death, I steeled myself to this last
duty. I wriggled painfully towards the corpse, and stretching
out my neatly-gloved fingers, with a last mighty effort
I pulled the paper cautiously from the dead hand which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
lay heavy upon it. Then I clasped it passionately to my
heart and died.&quot;</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Died?&quot; echoed Lillie excitedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;lost consciousness. You are particular to a
shade. Myself I see no difference between a fainting
fit and death except that one attack of the latter is
fatal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As to that,&quot; answered Lillie. &quot;I consider we die
every night and dream we are alive. To fall asleep is to
die painlessly. It is, perhaps, a pity we are resurrected
to tea and toast and toilette. However, I am glad you
did not really die. I feared I was in for a tale of re-incarnation
or spooks or hypnotism or telepathy or astral
bodies. One hears so many marvellous stories, now that
we have left off believing in miracles. Really, man&#39;s
credulity is the perpetual miracle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not left off believing in miracles,&quot; replied Miss
Linbridge seriously. &quot;How could I? Was I not saved
by one? A very gallant miracle, too, for it took no
trouble to save my crusty old fellow-traveller, while it left
me without a scratch. I am afraid I should not have
been grateful for salvation without good looks. To face
life without a pretty face were worse than death. You
agree with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not entirely. There are higher things in life than
beautiful faces,&quot; said Lillie gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Beautiful bonnets,&quot; said the candidate
with laughing levity. &quot;And lower things&mdash;beautiful
boots. But you would not seriously argue that there is
anything else so indispensable to a woman as beauty, or
that to live plain is worth the trouble of living?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? Plain living and high thinking!&quot; murmured
Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All nonsense! We needn&#39;t pretend&mdash;we aren&#39;t with
men. You would talk differently if you were born ugly!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
Goodness gracious, don&#39;t we know that a girl may have a
whole cemetery of virtues and no man will look at her if
she is devoid of charms of face or purse. It&#39;s all nonsense
what Ruskin says about a well-bred modest girl being
necessarily beautiful. It is only a pleasing fiction that morality
is invaluable to the complexion. Of course if Ruskin&#39;s
girl chose to dress with care, she could express her
goodness less plainly; but as a rule goodness and dowdiness
are synonymous. I think the function of a woman
is to look well, and our severest reprobation should be
extended to those conscienceless creatures who allow
themselves to be seen in the company of gentlemen in
frumpish attire. It is a breach of etiquette towards the
other sex. A woman must do credit to the man who
stakes his reputation for good taste by being seen in her
society. She must achieve beauty for his sake, and
should no more leave her boudoir without it than if she
were an actress leaving her dressing-room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That the man expects the woman to make his friends
envy him is true,&quot; answered Lillie, &quot;and I have myself
expressed this in yonder epigram, <i>It is man who is vain
of woman&#39;s dress</i>. But were we created merely to gratify
man&#39;s vanity?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is not that a place in nature to be vain of? We are
certainly not proud of him. Think of the average husband
over whom the woman has to shed the halo of her
beauty. It is like poetry and prose bound together. It
is because I intend to be permanently beautiful that I
have come to cast in my lot with the Old Maids&#39; Club.
Your rules ordain it so&mdash;and rightly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Club must be beautiful, certainly, but merely to
escape being twitted with ugliness by the shallow; for the
rest, it should disdain beauty. However, pray continue
your story. It left off at a most interesting point. You
lost consciousness!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
&quot;Yes, but as my chivalrous miracle had saved me from
damage, I was found unconsciously beautiful (which I
have always heard is the most graceful way of wearing
your beauty). I soon came to myself with the aid of a
dark-eyed doctor, and I then learnt that the old gentleman
had been too weak to sustain the shock and that his
poor old pulse had ceased to beat. My rescuers had not
disturbed <i>Threepenny Bits</i> from its position &#39;twixt my
hand and heart in case I should die and need it; so when
the line was cleared and I was sent on to London after a
pleasant lunch with the dark-eyed doctor, I had the journal
to read after all, despite the discourtesy of the deceased.
When I arrived at Paddington I found Richard Westbourne
walking the platform like Hamlet&#39;s ghost, white
and trembling. He was scanning the carriages feverishly,
as the train glided in with its habitual nonchalance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;My darling!&#39; he cried when he caught sight of my
dainty hat with its sweet trimmings. &#39;Thank Heaven!&#39;
He twisted the door violently open and kissed me before
the crowd. Fortunately I had my lovely spotted veil
all down, so he only pressed the tulle to my lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;What is the matter?&#39; I said ingenuously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The accident!&#39; he gasped. Weren&#39;t you in the
accident?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Of course I was. But I was not very much crumpled.
If I had sat in the other corner I should have
been killed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;My heroine!&#39; he cried. &#39;How brave of you!&#39; He
made as if he would rumple my hair but I drew back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Were you waiting for me?&#39; I asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Of course. Hours and hours. O the agony of it!
See, here is the evening paper! It gives you as dead.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Where?&#39; I cried, nervously. His trembling forefinger
pointed to the place. &#39;A beautiful young lady was also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
extricated in an unconscious condition from this carriage.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Isn&#39;t it wonderful the news should be in London
before me?&#39; I murmured. &#39;But I suppose they will have
names and fuller particulars in a later edition.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Of course. But fancy my having to be in London,
unable to get to you for love or money!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes, it was very hard for me to be there all alone,&#39;
I murmured. &#39;But please run and see after my luggage,
there are three portmanteaus and a little black one, and
three bonnet boxes, and two parasols, and call a hansom,
oh&mdash;and a brown paper parcel, and a long narrow
cardboard box&mdash;and get me the latest editions of the
evening papers&mdash;and please see that the driver isn&#39;t
drunk, and don&#39;t take a knock-kneed horse or one that
paws the ground, you know those hansom doors fly open
and shoot you out like rubbish&mdash;I do so hate them&mdash;and
oh! Richard, don&#39;t forget those novels from Mudie&#39;s,&mdash;they&#39;re
done up with a strap. Three bonnet boxes,
remember, and <i>all</i> the evening papers, mind.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When we were bowling homewards he kept expressing
his joy by word and deed, so that I was unable to read
my papers. At last, annoyed, I said: &#39;You wouldn&#39;t be
so glad if you knew that my resurrection cost three thousand
pounds.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;How do you mean?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Why, if I had died, somebody would have had three
thousand pounds. This number of <i>Threepenny Bits</i>
would have been found on my body, and would have
entitled my heir to that amount of assurance money. I
need not tell you who my heir is, nor to whom I had left
my little all.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I looked into his face and from the tenderness that
overflowed it I saw he fancied himself the favored
mortal. There is no end to the conceit of young men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
A sensible fellow would have known at once that my
brother was the only person reasonably entitled to my
scanty belongings. However, there is no good done by
disturbing a lover&#39;s complacency.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I do not want your money,&#39; he answered, again
passionately pressing my tulle veil to my lips. &#39;I infinitely
prefer your life.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;What a bloodthirsty highwayman!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I shall steal another kiss. I would rather have you
than all the gold in the world.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Still, gold is the next best thing,&#39; I said, smiling at
his affectionateness which my absence had evidently
fostered. &#39;So being on the point of death, as I thought,
I resolved to make death worth dying, and leave a heap
of gold to the man I loved. This number of <i>Threepenny
Bits</i> was not mine originally. When the crash occurred
it was being read by the old gentleman in the opposite
corner but his next of kin is a hypocritical young scapegrace
(so he told me) and I thought it would be far
nicer for <i>my</i> heir to come in for the money. So I took it
from his body the very instant before I fainted dead
away!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;My heroine!&#39; he cried again. &#39;So you thought of
your Richard even at the point of death. What a sweet
assurance of your love!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes, an assurance of three thousand pounds,&#39; I answered,
laughing merrily. &#39;And now, perhaps, you will
let me read the details of the catastrophe. The reporters
seem to know ever so much more about it than I do. It&#39;s
getting dusk and I can hardly see&mdash;I wonder what was
the name of old grizzly-growler&mdash;ah! here it is&mdash;&quot;The
pocket-book contained letters addressed to Josiah Twaddon,
Esquire, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Twaddon, did you say?&#39; gasped Richard, clutching
the paper frantically.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
&quot;&#39;Yes&mdash;don&#39;t! You&#39;ve torn it. Twaddon, I can see it
plainly.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Does it give his address?&#39; Richard panted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes,&#39; I said, surprised. I was just going on to read
that, &#39;4, Bucklesbury Buildings&mdash;&mdash;&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Great heavens!&#39; he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;What is it? Why are you so pale and agitated? Was
he anything to you. Ah, I guess it&mdash;by my prophetic
soul, your uncle!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes,&#39; he answered bitterly. &#39;My uncle! My
mother&#39;s brother! Wretched woman, what have you
done?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My heart was beating painfully and I felt hot all over,
but outwardly I froze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;You know what I have done,&#39; I replied icily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes, robbed me of three thousand pounds!&#39; he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;How dare you say that?&#39; I answered indignantly.
&#39;Why, it was for you I meant them.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The statement was not, perhaps, strictly accurate, but
my indignation was sufficiently righteous to cover a whole
pack of lies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Your intentions may have been strictly honorable,&#39;
he retorted, &#39;but your behavior was abominable. Great
heavens! Do you know that you could be prosecuted?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Nonsense!&#39; I said stoutly, though my heart misgave
me. &#39;What for?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;What for? You, a plunderer of the dead, a harpy,
a ghoul, ask what for?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;But the thing was of no value!&#39; I urged.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Of no intrinsic value, perhaps, but of immense value
under the peculiar circumstances. Why, if anyone chose
to initiate a prosecution, you would be sent to jail as a
common thief.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Pardon me,&#39; I said haughtily. &#39;You forget you are
speaking to a lady. As such, I can never be more than a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
kleptomaniac. You might make me suffer from hysteria
yesterday, but the worst that could befall me now would
be a most interesting advertisement. Prosecute me and
you will create for me an army of friends all over the
world. If it is thus that lovers behave, it is better to have
friends. I shall be glad of the exchange.&#39;</p>

<p class="center"><i>I can never be more than a kleptomaniac.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;You know I could not prosecute you,&#39; he answered
more gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;After your language to me you are capable of anything.
Your uncle called you a rogue with his dying
breath, and statements made with that are generally veracious.
Prosecute me if you will&mdash;I have done you out of
three thousand pounds and I am glad of it. Only one
favor I will ask of you&mdash;for the sake of our old relations,
give me fair warning!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;That you may flee the country?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;No, that I may get a new collection of photographs.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;You will submit to being taken by the police?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Yes&mdash;after I have been taken by the photographer.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;But look at the position you will be in?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I shall be in six different positions&mdash;one for each of
the chief illustrated papers.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Your flippancy is ill-timed, Margaret,&#39; said Richard
sternly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Flippant, good heavens! Do you know me so little
as to consider me capable of flippancy? Richard, this
is the last straw. You have called me a thief, you have
threatened to place me in the felon&#39;s dock, and I have
answered you with soft words, but no man shall call me
flippant and continue to be engaged to me!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;But, Maggie, darling!&#39; His tone was changing.
He saw he had gone too far. &#39;Consider! It is not only
I that am the loser by your&mdash;indiscretion, your generous
indiscretion&mdash;&mdash;&#39;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
&quot;&#39;My indiscreet generosity,&#39; I corrected.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He accepted my &#39;indiscreet generosity&#39; and went on.
&#39;Cannot you see that, as my future wife, you will also
suffer?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;But surely you will come in for something under your
uncle&#39;s will all the same,&#39; I reminded him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Not a stiver. He never made a will, he never saved
any money. He was the most selfish brute that ever
breathed. All the money he couldn&#39;t spend on himself
he gave away in charity so as to get the kudos during his
lifetime, pretending that there was no merit in post-mortem
philanthropy. And now all the good he might have
done by his death you have cancelled.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I sat mute, my complexion altered for the worse by
pangs of compunction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;But I can make amends,&#39; I murmured at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;How?&#39; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I can tell the truth&mdash;at least partially. I can make
an affidavit that <i>Threepenny Bits</i> belonged to my fellow-passenger,
that he lent it me just before the accident, or
that, seeing he was dead, I took it to hand over to his
relatives.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For a moment his face brightened up, then it grew dark
as suddenly as if it had been lit by electricity. &#39;They
will not believe you,&#39; he said. &#39;Even if you were a
stranger, the paper would contest my claim. But considering
your relation to me, considering that the money
would fall to you as much as to me, no common-sense jury
would credit your evidence.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Well, then, we must break off our engagement.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;What would be the good of that? They would ferret
out our past relations, would suspect their resumption
immediately after the verdict.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Well, then, we must break off our engagement,&#39; I
repeated decisively. &#39;I could never marry a prosecutor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
in posse&mdash;a man in whose heart was smouldering a petty
sense of pecuniary injury.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;If you married me, I should cease to be a prosecutor in
posse,&#39; he said soothingly. &#39;As the law stands, a husband
cannot give evidence against his wife in criminal cases.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oh, well, then you&#39;d become a persecutor in esse,&#39; I
retorted. &#39;You&#39;d always have something to throw in
my teeth, and for my part I could never forgive you the
wrong I have done you. We could not possibly live together.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My demeanor was so chilling, my tone so resolute
that Richard was panic-stricken. He vowed, protested,
stormed, entreated, but nothing could move me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;A kindly accident has shown me your soul,&#39; I answered,
&#39;and the sight is not encouraging. Fortunately I
have seen it in time. You remember when you took me
to see <i>The Doll&#39;s House</i>, you said that Norah was quite
right in all she did. I daresay it was because the actress
was so charming&mdash;but let that pass. And yet what are
you but another Helmer? Just see how exact is the parallel
between our story and Ibsen&#39;s. Norah in all innocence
forged her husband&#39;s name in order to get the
money to restore him to health. I, in all innocence, steal
a threepenny paper, in order to leave you three thousand
pounds by my death. When things turn out wrong, you
turn round on me just as Helmer turned round on Norah&mdash;forgetting
for whose sake the deed was done. If Norah
was justified in leaving her husband, how much more
justified must I be in leaving my betrothed!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The cases are not quite on all fours,&quot; interrupted the
President who had pricked up her ears at the mention of
the &quot;Woman&#39;s Poet.&quot; &quot;You must not forget that you did
not really sin for his sake but for your brother&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is an irrelevant detail,&quot; replied the beautiful
ghoul. &quot;He thought I did&mdash;which comes to the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
thing. Besides, my telling him I did only increases the
resemblance between me and Norah. She was an awful
fibber, if you remember. Richard, of course, disclaimed
the likeness to Helmer, though in doing so he was more
like him than ever. But I would give him no word of
hope. &#39;We could never be happy together,&#39; I said.
&#39;Our union would never be real. There would always
be the three thousand pounds between us.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Well, that would be fifteen hundred each,&#39; he answered
with ghastly jocularity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;This ill-timed flippancy ends all,&#39; I said solemnly.
&#39;Henceforth, Mr. Westbourne, we must be strangers.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He sat like one turned to stone. Not till the cab arrived
at my brother&#39;s house did he speak again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then he said in low tones: &#39;Maggie, can I never
become anything to you but a stranger?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The greatest miracle of all would have to happen then,
Richard,&#39; I quoted coldly. Then, rejecting his proffered
assistance, I alighted from the vehicle, passed majestically
across the threshold and mounted the stairs with stately
step, not a sign, not the slightest tremor of a muscle betraying
what I felt. Only when I was safe in my own little
room, with its lavender-scented sheets and its thousand
childish associations did my pent-up emotions overpower
me. I threw myself upon my little white bed in a paroxysm
of laughter. I had come out of a disagreeable situation
agreeably, leaving Dick in the wrong, and I felt sure
I could whistle him back as easily as the hansom.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what became of Richard?&quot; asked Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I left him to settle with the cabman. I have never
seen him since.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie gave a little shudder. &quot;You speak as if the cabman
had settled with him. But are you sure you are willing
to renounce all mankind because you find one man
unsatisfactory?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
&quot;All. I was very young when I got engaged. I did
not want to be a burden on my brother. But now his firework
factory is a brilliant success. He lives in a golden
rain. Having only myself to please now, I don&#39;t see why
I should have to please a husband. The more I think of
marriage the less I think of it. I have not kept my eyes
open for nothing. I am sure it wouldn&#39;t suit me. Husbands
are anything but the creatures a young girl&#39;s romantic
fancy pictures. They have a way of disarranging the
most careful toilettes. They ruffle your hair and your
temper. They disorder the furniture&mdash;and put their feet
on the mantelpiece. They scratch the fenders, read books
and stretch themselves on the most valuable sofas. If they
help in the household they only make more work. The
trail of tobacco is over all you prize. All day long the
smoke gets into your eyes. Filthy pipes clog your cabinets,
your window-curtains reek of stale cigars. You have
bartered your liberty for a mess of cigar-ash. There is an
odor of bar saloons about the house and boon companions
come to welter in whiskey and water. Their talk is of
science and art and politics and it makes them guffaw
noisily and dig one another in the ribs. There is not a
man in the world to whom I would trust my sensitive
fragility&mdash;they are all coarse, clumsy creatures with a code
of morals that they don&#39;t profess and a creed of chivalry
that they never practise. Falsehood abides permanently
in their mouth like artificial teeth and corruption lurks
beneath the whited sepulchres of their shirt-fronts. They
adore us in secret and deride us when they are together.
They feign a contempt for us which we feel for them.&quot;
These sentiments re-instated Miss Linbridge in the good
opinion of the President, conscious heretofore of a jarring
chord. She ordered in some refreshments to get an opportunity
of whispering to Turple the magnificent that the
Honorary Trier might return.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
&quot;Oh, by the way,&quot; said Miss Linbridge, &quot;I hunted out
that copy of <i>Threepenny Bits</i> before coming out. I&#39;ve
kept it in a drawer as a curiosity. Here it is!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie took the paper and examined it anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s that? <i>You</i> reading <i>Threepenny Bits</i>?&quot; said
Silverdale coming in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is only an old number,&quot; said Lillie, &quot;whereby hangs
a tale. Miss Linbridge was in a railway accident with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Linbridge, Lord Silverdale.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Honorary Trier bowed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh what a pity it was an old number,&quot; he said. &quot;Miss
Linbridge might have had a claim for damages.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How very ungallant,&quot; said Lillie. &quot;Miss Linbridge
could have had no claim unless she had been killed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides,&quot; added Miss Linbridge laughing at Lillie&#39;s
bull, &quot;it wasn&#39;t an old number then. The accident
happened on New Year&#39;s Day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Even then it would have been too old,&quot; answered
Silverdale, &quot;for it is dated December 2d and the assurance
policy is only valid during the week of issue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that?&quot; gasped Miss Linbridge. Her face
was passing through a variety of shades.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Lillie. &quot;Here is the condition in print.
You don&#39;t seem to have noticed it was a back number.
But of course I don&#39;t wonder at that&mdash;there&#39;s no topical
interest whatever, one week&#39;s very much like another.
And see! Here is even &#39;Specimen Copy&#39; marked on
the outside sheet. Richard&#39;s uncle must have had it given
to him in the street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The miracle!&quot; exclaimed Miss Linbridge in exultant
tones, and repossessing herself of the paper she darted
from the Club.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span></p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="center">&quot;LA FEMME INCOMPRISE.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Silverdale had gone and there was now no need
for Lillie to preserve the factitious cheerfulness with which
she had listened to his usual poem, while her thoughts were
full of other and even more depressing things. Margaret
Linbridge&#39;s miracle had almost undermined the President&#39;s
faith in the steadfastness of her sex; she turned
mentally to the yet unaccepted Wee Winnie for consolation,
condemning her own half-hearted attitude towards
that sturdy soul, and almost persuading herself that salvation
lay in spats. At any rate long skirts seemed the last
thing in the world to find true women in.</p>

<p class="indent">But providence had not exhausted its miracles, and Lillie
was not to spend a miserable afternoon. The miracle
was speeding along towards her on the top of an omnibus&mdash;a
miracle of beauty and smartness. On reaching the
vicinity of the Old Maid&#39;s Club, the miracle, which was
of course of the female gender, tapped the driver amicably
upon the hat with her parasol and said &quot;Stop please.&quot; The
<i>petite</i> creature was the spirit of self-help itself and scorned
the aid of the gentleman in front of her, preferring to
knock off his hat and crush the driver&#39;s so long as the independence
of womanhood was maintained. But she
maintained it charmingly and without malice and gave
the conductor a sweet smile in addition to his fare as she
tripped away to the Old Maids&#39; Club.</p>

Lillie was fascinated the instant Turple the magnificent
announced &quot;Miss Wilkins&quot; in suave tones. The mere
advent of a candidate raised her spirits and she found
herself chatting freely with her visitor even before she
had put her through the catechism. But the catechism
came at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do I want to join you?&quot; asked the miracle.
&quot;Because I am disgusted with my lover&mdash;because I am
a <i>femme incomprise</i>. Oh, don&#39;t stare at me as if I were a
medley of megrims and fashionable ailments, I&#39;m the very
opposite of that. Mine is a buoyant, breezy, healthy
nature, straightforward and simple. That&#39;s why I complain
of being misunderstood. My lover is a poet&mdash;and the
misunderstanding I have to endure at his hands is something
appalling. Every man is a bit of a poet where woman
is concerned, and so every woman is more or less misunderstood,
but when you are unfortunate enough to excite
the affection of a real whole poet&mdash;well, that way madness
lies. Your words are twisted into meanings you never
intended, your motives are misconstrued, and your simplest
actions are distorted. Silverplume, for it is the well-known
author of &#39;Poems of Compassion&#39; that I have had
the misfortune to captivate, never calls without laying a
sonnet next day; in which remarks, that must be most misleading
to those who do not know me, occur with painful
frequency. His allowance is two kisses per day&mdash;one of
salutation, one of farewell. We have only been actually
engaged two months, yet I have counted up two hundred
and thirty-nine distinct and separate kisses in the voluminous
&#39;Sonnet Series&#39; which he has devoted to our engagement,
and, what is worse, he describes himself as
depositing them.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Where at thy flower-mouth exiguous</span><br />
<span class="i0">The purple passion mantles to the brim.&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
It sounds as if I was berouged like a dowager. Purple
passion, indeed! I let him kiss me because he appears
to like it and because there seems something wrong about
it&mdash;but as for really caring a pin one way or another,
well, you Miss Dulcimer, know how much there is in
that! This &#39;Sonnet Series&#39; promises to be endless, the
course of our acquaintanceship is depicted in its most
minute phases with the most elaborate inaccuracy&mdash;if I
smile, if I say: &#39;How do you do?&#39; if I put my hand to
my forehead, if I look into the fire, down go fourteen lines
giving a whole world of significance to my meanest actions,
and making Himalayas out of the most microscopic molehills.
I am credited with thoughts I never dreamed of
and sentiments I never felt, till I ask myself whether any
other woman was ever so cruelly misunderstood as I? I
grow afraid to do or say anything, lest I bring upon my
head a new sonnet. But even so I cannot help <i>looking</i>
something or the other; and when I come to read the
sonnet I find it is always the other. Once I refused to
see him for a whole week, but that only resulted in seven
&#39;Sonnets of Absence,&#39; imaginatively depicting what I
was saying and doing each day, and containing a detailed
analysis of his own sensations, as well as reminiscences
of past happy hours together. Most of them I had no
recollection of, and the only one I could at all share was
that of a morning we spent on the Ramsgate cliffs where
Silverplume put his handkerchief over his face and fell
asleep. In the last line of the sonnet it came out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;There mid the poppies of the planisphere,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I swooned for very joy and wearihead.&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">But I knew it by the poppies. Then, dear Miss Dulcimer,
you should just see the things he calls me&mdash;&#39;Love&#39;s
gonfalon and lodestar&#39; and what-not. Very often I can&#39;t
even find them in the dictionary and it makes me uneasy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
Heaven knows what he may be saying about me! When
he talks of</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;The rack of unevasive lunar things&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">I do not so much complain, because it&#39;s their concern if
they are libelled. It is different with incomprehensible
remarks flung unmistakably at my own head such as</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;O chariest of Caryatides.&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It sounds like a reproach and I should like to know what
I have done to deserve it. And then his general remarks
are so monotonously unintelligible. One of his longest
poetical epistles, which is burnt into my memory because
I had to pay twopence for extra postage, began with this
lament:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;O sweet are roses in the summer time</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Indian naiads&#39; weary walruses</span><br />
<span class="i0">And yet two-morrow never comes to-day.&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">I cannot see any way out of it all except by breaking off
our engagement. When we were first engaged, I don&#39;t
deny I rather liked being written about in lovely-sounding
lines but it is a sweet one is soon surfeited with, and Silverplume
has raved about me to that extent that he has
made me look ridiculous in the eyes of all my friends. If
he had been moderate, they would have been envious;
now they laugh when they read of my wonderful charms,
of my lithe snake&#39;s mouth, and my face which shames the
sun and my Epipsychidiontic eyes (whatever that may be)
and my</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Wee waist that holds the cosmos in its span,&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">and say he is poking fun at me. But Silverplume is quite
serious&mdash;I am sure of that, and it is the worst feature of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
the case. He carries on just the same in conversation,
with the most improper allusions to heathen goddesses,
and seems really to believe that I am absorbed in the
sunset when I am thinking what to wear to-morrow. Just
to give you an idea of how he misinterprets my silence let
me read to you one of his sonnets called:</p>

<p class="center">&quot;&#39;MOONSHINE.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Walking a space betwixt the double Naught,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The What Is Bound to Be and What Has Been,</span><br />
<span class="i0">How sweet with Thee beneath the moonlit treen,</span><br />
<span class="i0">O woman-soul immaculately wrought,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To sit and catch a harmony uncaught</span><br />
<span class="i0">Within a world that mocks with margarine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In chastened silence, mystic, epicene,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Exchanging incommunicable thought.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Diana, Death may doom and Time may toss,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And sundry other kindred things occur,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But Hell itself can never turn to loss,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though Mephistopheles his stumps should stir,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That day, when introduced at Charing Cross,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I smiled and doffed my silken cylinder.&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another distressing feature about Silverplume&mdash;indeed,
I think about all men&mdash;is their continuous capacity
for love-making. You know, my dear Miss Dulcimer,
with us it is a matter of times and seasons&mdash;we are creatures
of strange and subtle susceptibilities, sometimes we are
in the mood for love and ready to respond to all shades
of sentimentality, but at other moments (and these the
majority) men&#39;s amorous advances jar horribly. Men do
not know this. Ever ready to make love themselves they
think all moments are the same to us as to them. And of
all men, poets are the most prepared to make love at a
moment&#39;s notice. So that Silverplume himself is almost
more trying than his verses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
&quot;But after all you need not read them,&quot; observed Lillie.
&quot;They please him and they do not hurt you. And you
have always the consolation of remembering it is not you
he loves but the paragon he has evolved from his inner
consciousness. Even taking into account his perennial
affectionateness, your reason for refusing him seems
scarcely strong enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, wait a moment&mdash;You have not heard the worst!
I might perhaps have tolerated his metrical misinterpretations&mdash;indeed
on my sending him a vigorous protest
against the inaccuracies of his last collection (they came out
so much more glaringly when brought all together from the
various scattered publications to which Silverplume originally
contributed them) he sent me back a semi-apologetic
explanation thus conceived:</p>

<p class="center">&quot;&#39;TO CELIA.&#39;</p>

<p class="center">&quot;(You know of course my name is Diana, but that is his way.)</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;&#39;Tis not alone thy sweet eyes&#39; gleam</span><br />
<span class="i2">Nor sunny glances,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For which I weave so oft a dream</span><br />
<span class="i2">Of dainty fancies.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;&#39;Tis not alone thy witching play</span><br />
<span class="i2">Of grace fantastic</span><br />
<span class="i0">That makes me chant so oft a lay</span><br />
<span class="i2">Encomiastic.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Both editors and thee I see,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Thy face, their purses.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I offer heart and soul to thee,</span><br />
<span class="i2">To them my verses.&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was partially mollified by this, for if his poems were
not merely complimentary, and he really got paid for them,
one might put up with inspiring them. We were reconciled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
and he took me to a reception at the house of a
wealthy friend of his, a fellow-member of the Sonneteers&#39;
Society. It was here that I saw a sight that froze my
young blood and warned me upon the edge of what a
precipice I was standing. When we got into the drawing-room,
the first thing we saw was an awful apparition in a
corner&mdash;a hideous, unkempt, unwashed man in a dressing-gown
and slippers, with his eyes rolling wildly and his lips
moving rhythmically. It was the host.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Don&#39;t speak to him,&#39; whispered the hostess. &#39;He
doesn&#39;t see us. He has been like that all day. He came
down to look to the decorations this morning, when the
idea took him and he has been glued to the spot ever
since. He has forgotten all about the reception&mdash;he
doesn&#39;t know we&#39;re here and I thought it best not to disturb
him till he is safely delivered of the sonnet.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;You are quite right,&#39; everybody said in sympathetic
awestruck tones and left a magic circle round the poet in
labor. But I felt a shudder run through my whole being.
&#39;Goodness gracious, Silverplume,&#39; I said, &#39;is this the way
you poets go on?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;No, no, Diana,&#39; he assured me. &#39;It is all tommyrot
(I quote Silverplume&#39;s words). The beggar is just bringing
out a new volume, and although his wife has always
distributed the most lavish hospitality to the critics, he
has never been able to get himself taken seriously as a
poet. There will be lots of critics here to-night and he is
playing his last card. If he is not a genius now, he never
will be.&#39;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oh, of course,&#39; I replied sceptically, &#39;two of a trade.&#39;
I made him take me away and that was the end of our
engagement. Even as it was, Silverplume&#39;s neglect of
his appearance had been a constant thorn in my side, and
if this was so before marriage, what could I hope for after?
It was all very well for him to say his friend was only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
shamming, but even so, how did I know he would not be
reduced to that sort of thing himself when his popularity
faded and younger rivals came along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie, who seemed to have some <i>arrière-pensée</i>, entered
into an animated defence of the poet, but Miss
Wilkins stood her ground and refused to withdraw her
candidature.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want you to withdraw your candidature,&quot; said
Lillie, frankly. &quot;I shall be charmed to entertain it. I
am only arguing upon the general question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And, indeed, Lillie was enraptured with Miss Wilkins.
It was the attraction of opposites. A matter-of-fact
woman who could reject a poet&#39;s love appealed to her
with irresistible piquancy. Miss Wilkins stayed on to tea
(by which time she had become Diana) and they gossiped
on all sorts of subjects, and Lillie gave her the outlines of
the queerest stories of past candidates and in the Old
Maids&#39; Club that afternoon all went merry as a marriage
bell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, good-bye, Lillie,&quot; said Diana at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye, Diana,&quot; returned Lillie. &quot;Now <i>I</i> understand
you I hope you won&#39;t consider yourself a <i>femme
incomprmise</i> any longer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is only the men I complained of, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we must ever remain <i>incomprises</i> by man,&quot; said
Lillie. &quot;<i>Femme incomprise</i>&mdash;why, it is the badge of all our
sex.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Diana. &quot;A woman letting down her
back hair is tragic to a man; to us she only recalls bedroom
gossip. Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And nodding brightly the brisk little creature sallied
into the street and captured a passing &#39;bus.</p>

<p class="center">THE INAUGURAL SOIREE.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Lord Silverdale,&quot; cried Lillie exultantly when he
made his usual visit the next afternoon. &quot;At last I have
an unexceptional candidate. We shall get under weigh
at last. I am so pleased because papa keeps bothering
about that inaugural <i>soirée</i>. You know he is staying in

don&#39;t seem to be glad at my news.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid you will be grieved at mine,&quot; he replied
gravely. &quot;Look at this in to-day&#39;s <i>Moon</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sobered by his manner, she took the paper. Then her

<p class="indent">&quot;I called at the Old Maids&#39; Club yesterday,&quot; writes a
<i>Moon</i> woman, &quot;to get some wrinkles, which ought to be
abundant in such a Club, though they are not. Miss
Dulcimer, the well-known authoress, is one of the loveliest
and jolliest girls of the day. Of course I went as a
candidate, with a trumped-up story about my unhappy
past, which Miss Dulcimer will, I am sure, forgive me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>

<p class="indent">Lillie&#39;s eye glanced rapidly down the collection of distortions.
Then she dropped the <i>Moon</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is outrageous,&quot; she said. &quot;I can never forgive

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, is this the candidate you were telling me about?&quot;
asked Silverdale in deeper concern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid it is!&quot; said Lillie, almost weeping. &quot;I
took to her so, we talked ever so long. Even Wee Winnie
did not possess the material for all these inaccuracies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is this woman&#39;s name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wilkins&mdash;I already called her Diana.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Diana?&quot; cried Silverdale. &quot;Wilkins? Great heavens,
can it be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must be. Wilkins has married his Diana. It was
Mrs. Diana Wilkins who called upon you&mdash;not Miss at
all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What <i>are</i> you talking about? Who are these people?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you remember Wilkins, the <i>Moon</i>-man that I
was up in a balloon with? He was in a frightful quandary
then about his approaching marriage. He did not
know what to do. It tortured him to hear anyone ask a
question because he was always interviewing people and
he got to hate the very sound of an interrogation.&mdash;I told
you about it at the time, don&#39;t you remember?&mdash;and he
knew that marriage would bring into his life a person who
would be sure to ask him questions after business hours.
I was very sorry for the man and tried to think of a way
out, but in vain, and I even promised him to bring
the Old Maids&#39; Club under the notice of his Diana. Now
it seems he has hit on the brilliant solution of making her
into a Lady Interviewer, so that her nerves, too, shall be
hypersensitive to interrogatives, and husband and wife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
shall sit at home in a balsamic restfulness permeated by
none but categorical propositions. Ah me! well, I envy
them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You envy them?&quot; said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? They are well matched.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you are as happy as Wilkins, surely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Query. It takes two to find happiness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What nonsense!&quot; said Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">She had been already so upset by the treachery and loss
of the misunderstood Diana, that she felt ready to break
down and shed hot tears over these heretical sentiments
of Silverdale&#39;s. He had been so good, so patient. Why
should he show the cloven hoof just to-day?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Dolly Vane,&quot; announced Turple the magnificent.</p>

<p class="indent">A strange apparition presented itself&mdash;an ancient lady
quaintly attired. Her dress fell in voluminous folds&mdash;the
curious full skirt was bordered with velvet, and there were
huge lace frills on the elbow-sleeves. Her hair was
smoothed over her ears and she wore a Leghorn hat.
There were the remains of beauty on her withered face
but her eyes were wild and wandering. She curtseyed to
the couple with old-fashioned grace, and took the chair
which Lord Silverdale handed her.</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have I the pleasure of speaking to Miss Dulcimer?&quot;
said the old lady. Her tones were cracked and quavering.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am Miss Dulcimer,&quot; replied Lillie. &quot;What can I
do for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes, I have been reading about you in the <i>Moon</i>
to-day. Wee Winnie and Lillie Dulcimer! Wee Winnie!
It reminds me of myself. They call me Little Dolly, you
know.&quot; She simpered in a ghastly manner.</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie&#39;s face was growing pale. She could not speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes of course,&quot; said Silverdale smiling. &quot;They
call you Little Dolly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
&quot;Little Dolly!&quot; she repeated to herself, mumbling and
chuckling. &quot;Little Dolly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you have been reading about Miss Dulcimer!&quot;
said Silverdale pleasantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said the old lady, looking up with a start.
&quot;Little Lillie Dulcimer. Foundress of the Old Maids&#39;
Club. That&#39;s the thing for me, I thought to myself.
That&#39;ll punish Philip. That&#39;ll punish him for being away
so long. When he comes home and finds Little Dolly is
an old maid, won&#39;t he be sorry, poor Philip? But I can&#39;t
help it. I said I would punish him and I will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All the blood had left Lillie&#39;s cheek&mdash;she trembled and
caught hold of Lord Silverdale&#39;s arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shan&#39;t have you now, Philip,&quot; the creaking tones of
the old lady continued after a pause. &quot;The rules will
not allow it, will they, Miss Dulcimer? It is not enough
that I am young and beautiful, I must reject somebody&mdash;and
I have nobody else to reject but you, Philip. You
are the only man I have ever loved. Oh my Philip! My
poor Philip!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She began to wring her hands. Lillie pressed closer to
Lord Silverdale and her grasp on his arm tightened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, we will put your name on the books at
once,&quot; said the Honorary Trier, in bluff, hearty tones.</p>

<p class="indent">Little Dolly looked up smiling. &quot;Then I&#39;m an old
maid!&quot; she cried ecstatically. &quot;Already! Little Dolly
an old maid! Already! Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She went off into a burst of uncanny laughter. Lord
Silverdale felt Lillie shuddering violently. He disengaged
himself from her grasp and placed her on the sofa. Then
offering his arm to Miss Dolly Vane, who accepted it with
a charming smile, and a curtsey to Miss Dulcimer, he led
her from the apartment. When he returned Lillie was
weeping half-hysterically on the sofa.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My darling!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Calm yourself.&quot; He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
laid his hand tenderly on her hair. Presently the sobs
ceased.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Lord Silverdale!&quot; she said in a shaken voice.
&quot;How good you are! Poor old lady! Poor old lady!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not distress yourself. I have taken care she shall
get home safely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Little Dolly! how tragic it was!&quot; whispered Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it was tragic. Probably it is not now so sad to
her as it is to us, but it is tragic enough, heaven knows.
Lillie,&quot;&mdash;he trembled as he addressed her thus for the
first time&mdash;&quot;I am not sorry this has happened. The
time has come to put an end to all this make-believe.
This Old Maids&#39; Club of yours is a hollow mockery. You
are playing round the fringes of tragedy&mdash;it is like warming
your hands at a house on fire, wherein wretched
beings are shrieking for help. You are young and rich
and beautiful&mdash;Heaven pity the women who have none
of these charms. Life is a cruel tragedy for many&mdash;never
crueller than when its remorseless laws condemn gentle
loving women to a crabbed and solitary old age. To some
all the smiles of fortune, the homage of all mankind&mdash;to
others all the frowns of fate and universal neglect, aggravated
by contumely. You have felt this, I know, and it is
as a protest that you conceived your club. Still can it
ever be a serious success? I love you, Lillie, and you
have known it all along. If I have entered into the joke,
believe me, I have sometimes taken it as seriously as you.
Come! Say you love me, too, and let us end the tragi-comedy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie was obstinately silent for a moment, then she
dried her eyes, and with a wan little smile said, in tones
which she vainly strove to render those of the usual
formula: &quot;What poem have you brought me to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-day I have brought no poem, but I have lived
one,&quot; said Lord Silverdale, taking her soft unresisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
hand. &quot;But, like Lady Clara Vere de Vere, you put
strange memories in my head, and I will tell you some
verses I made in the country in my callow youth, when
the world was new.</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie&#39;s hand pressed her lover&#39;s with involuntary tenderness,
but she had turned her face away. Presently
she murmured:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But think what you are asking me to do? How can
I, the President of the Old Maid&#39;s Club, be the first
recreant?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you are also the last to leave the ship,&quot; he replied,
smiling. &quot;Besides, you are not legally elected.
You never came before the Honorary Trier. You were
never a member at all, so have nothing to undo. If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
had stood your trial fairly, I should have plucked you, my
Lillie, plucked you and worn you nearest my heart. It is
I who have a position to resign&mdash;the Honorary Triership&mdash;and
I resign it instanter. A nice trying time I have
had, to be sure!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, now! I set my face against punning!&quot; said
Lillie, showing it now, for the smiles had come to hide the
tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon, Rainbow,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you call me Rainbow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you look it,&quot; he said. &quot;Because your face
is made of sunshine and tears. Go and look in the glass.
Also because&mdash;well, wait and I will fashion my other
reason into rhyme and send it you on our wedding
morn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poetry made while you wait,&quot; said Lillie, laughing.
The laugh froze suddenly on her lips, and a look of horror
overswept her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, dearest?&quot; cried her lover, in alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wee Winnie! How can we face Wee Winnie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no need to break the truth to her&mdash;we can
simply get rid of her by telling her she has never been
elected, and never will be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; said Lillie, with a comic <i>moue</i>, &quot;that would be
harder to tell her than the truth. But we must first of
all tell father. I am afraid he will be dreadfully disappointed
at missing that inaugural <i>soirée</i> after all. You
know he has been staying in town expressly for it. We
have some bad quarters of an hour before us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They sought the millionaire in his sanctum but found
him not. They inquired of Turple the magnificent, and
learned that he was in the garden. As they turned away,
the lovers both simultaneously remarked something peculiar
about the face of Turple the magnificent. Moved
by a common impulse, they turned back and gazed at it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
For some seconds they could not at all grasp the change
that had come over it&mdash;but at last, and almost at the same
instant, they realized what was the matter.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Turple the magnificent was smiling.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Filled with strange apprehensions, Silverdale and Lillie
hurried into the garden, where their vague alarm was exchanged
for definite consternation. The millionaire was
pacing the gravel-paths in the society of a strange and
beautiful lady. On closer inspection, the lady turned
out to be only too familiar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why it&#39;s Wee Winnie masquerading as a woman!&quot;
exclaimed Lord Silverdale.</p>

<p class="indent">And so it proved&mdash;Nelly Nimrod in all the flush of her
womanly beauty, her mannish attire discarded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, what is this, father?&quot; murmured Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My child,&quot; said the millionaire solemnly. &quot;As <i>you</i>
have resolved to be an Old Maid, I&mdash;I&mdash;well I thought it
only <i>my</i> duty to marry. Even the poorest millionaire cannot
shirk the responsibilities of wealth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But father!&quot; said Lillie in dismay. &quot;I have changed
my mind. I am going to marry Lord Silverdale.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bless ye, my children!&quot; said the millionaire. &quot;You
are a woman, Lillie, and it is a woman&#39;s privilege to change
her mind. But I am a man and have no such privilege.
I must marry all the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Miss Nimrod has changed her mind, too,&quot; said
Lillie, quite losing her temper. &quot;And <i>she</i> is not a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gently, gently,&quot; said the millionaire. &quot;Respect your
stepmother to be, if you have no respect for my future
wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lillie,&quot; said Miss Nimrod appealingly, &quot;do not misjudge
me. I have <i>not</i> changed my mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you said you could never marry, on the ground
that while you would only marry an unconventional man,
an unconventional man wouldn&#39;t want to marry you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
&quot;Well? Your father is the man I sought. He <i>didn&#39;t</i>
want to marry me,&quot; she explained frankly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Lillie, taken utterly aback, and regarding
her father commiseratingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is true,&quot; he said, laughing uneasily. &quot;I fell in love
with Wee Winnie, but now Nelly says she wants to settle
down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to be grateful to me, Lillie,&quot; added Nelly,
&quot;for it was solely in the interest of the Old Maid&#39;s Club
that I consented to marry your father. He was always a
danger to the Club; at any moment he might have put
forth autocratic authority and wound it up. So I thought
that by marrying him I should be able to influence him
in its favor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt you <i>will</i> make him see the desirability of
women remaining old maids,&quot; retorted Lillie unappeased.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, come, Lillie, be sensible!&quot; said the millionaire.
&quot;Nelly shall give Lillie a good dinner at the Junior Widows,
one of those charming dinners you and I have had there,
and Lillie please send out the cards for the inaugural
<i>soirée</i>. I am not going to be done out of that and nothing
can now be gained by delay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, sir, how can we inaugurate a Club which has never
had any members?&quot; asked Silverdale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what does that matter? Aren&#39;t there plenty of
candidates without them? Besides, nobody&#39;ll know. Each
of the candidates will think the others are the members.
Tell you what, boy, they shall all dance at Lillie&#39;s wedding,
and we&#39;ll make that the inaugural <i>soirée</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that would be to publish my failure to the world,&quot;
remonstrated Lillie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense, dear. It&#39;ll be published without that.
Trust the <i>Moon</i>. Isn&#39;t it better to take the bull by the
horns?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes, perhaps you&#39;re right,&quot; said Lillie hesitating.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
&quot;But I hope the world will understand that it is only desperation
at the collapse of the Old Maids&#39; Club that has
driven me to commit matrimony.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She went back to the Club to write out the cards.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of my stepmother?&quot; she inquired
pathetically of the ex-Honorary Trier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do I think?&quot; said Lord Silverdale seriously.
&quot;I think she is the punishment of Providence for your
interference with its designs.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The explanatory poem duly came to hand on Lillie&#39;s
wedding morn. It was written on vellum in the bridegroom&#39;s
best hand and ran&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">RAINBOW.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, why I call you &quot;Rainbow,&quot; sweet?</span><br />

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You smile in your superior way,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Created but to soothe and bless,</span><br />

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My life was chilled and wan and hoary,</span><br />

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Besides the friends of the happy pair, nearly all the
candidates were present at the inaugural <i>soirée</i> of the
Old Maids&#39; Club. Not quite all&mdash;because Lillie who was
rapidly growing conventional did not care to have Clorinda
Bell even accompanied by her mother, or by her brother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
the Man in the Ironed Mask. Nor did she invite the twins,
nor the osculatory Alice. But she conquered her prejudices
in other instances, and Frank Maddox, the art critic, came
under the convoy of the composer, Paul Horace, and Miss
Mary Friscoe was brought by Bertie Smythe. The Writers&#39;
Club also sent Ellaline Rand, and an account of the proceedings
appeared in the first number of the <i>Cherub</i>. The
&quot;Princess&quot; was brought by Miss Primpole, and Captain
Athelstan and Lord Arthur came together in unimpaired
friendship. Eustasia Pallas and her husband, Percy Swinshell
Spatt, both their faces full of the peace that passeth
understanding, got a night off for the occasion and came
in a hansom paid for out of the week&#39;s beer-money. Turple
the magnificent, who had seen them at home in the
servants&#39; hall, was outraged in his deepest instincts and
multiplied occasions for offering them refreshments merely
for the pleasure of snorting in their proximity. The great
Fladpick (Frank Gray), accompanied by his newly-won
bride, Cecilia, made the evening memorable by the presence
of the English Shakespeare, Guy Fledgely brought
Miss Sybil Hotspur, and his father, the baronet, was under
the care of Miss Jack. The lady from Boston wired congratulations
on the success of the Club from Yokohama
whither she had gone to pick up lacquer-work. Poor Miss
Summerson, the lovely May, and the victim of the Valentine
were a triad that was much admired. Miss Fanny
Radowski, whose Oriental loveliness excited much attention,
came, with Martin. Winifred Woodpecker was accompanied
by her mother, the resemblance between the
two being generally remarked, and Miss Margaret Linbridge
seemed to afford Richard Westbourne copious opportunities
for jealousy. Even Wilkins was there with his
Diana, in an unprofessional capacity, Lillie having relented
towards her interviewer on learning that she had been
really engaged to Silverplume once and that she had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
entirely drawn on the stores of journalistic fancy. Silverplume
himself was there, unconscious to what he owed
the invitation, and paying marked attention to the unattached
beauties. Miss Nimrod promenaded the rooms on
the arm of the millionaire. She had improved vastly since
she had become effeminate, and Lillie felt she could put up
with her, now she would not have to live with her. Even
Silverdale&#39;s aunt, Lady Goody-Goody Twoshoes could
find no fault with Nelly now.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a brilliant scene. The apartments of the Old
Maids&#39; Club had been artistically decked with the most
gorgeous flowers that the millionaire could afford, and the
epigrams had been carefully removed so as to leave the
rooms free for dancing. As Lillie&#39;s father gazed around,
he felt that not many millionaires could secure such a
galaxy of beauty as circled in the giddy dance in his gilded
saloon. It was, indeed, an unexampled gathering of
pretty girls&mdash;this inaugural <i>soirée</i> of the Old Maids&#39; Club,
and the millionaire&#39;s shirt-front heaved with pride and
pleasure and the Letter-Day Cupid that still hung on the
wall seemed to take heart of grace again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You got my verses this morning, Rainbow mine?&quot;
said Silverdale, when the carriage drove off, and the honeymoon
began.</p>

<p class="indent">It was almost the first moment they had had together
the whole day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Lillie softly. &quot;And I wanted to tell you
there are two lines which are truer than you meant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am indeed, a poet, then! Which are they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie blushed sweetly. Presently she murmured,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;You followed logic to excess,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Repressing thoughts of tenderness.&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you know that?&quot; she asked, her brown eyes
looking ingenuously into his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Love&#39;s divination, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
&quot;My father didn&#39;t tell you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About my discovery in the algebra of love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Algebra of love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, of course he didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t suppose he ever
really understood it,&quot; said Lillie with a pathetic smile.
&quot;I think I ought to tell you now what it was that made
me so&mdash;so&mdash;you understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put her little warm hand lightly into his and nestled
against his shoulder, as if to make amends.</p>

<p class="indent">After a delicious silence, for Lord Silverdale betrayed
no signs of impatience, Lillie confessed all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you see I have loved you all along!&quot; she concluded.
&quot;Only I did not dare hope that the chance would
come to pass, against which the odds were 5999.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But great heavens!&quot; cried Lord Silverdale, &quot;do you
mean to say this is why you were so cold to me all those
long weary months?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the only reason,&quot; faltered Lillie. &quot;But would
you have had me defy the probabilities?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, of course not. I wouldn&#39;t dream of such a
thing. But you have miscalculated them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miscalculated them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie began to tremble violently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, there is a fallacy in your ratiocination.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A fallacy!&quot; she whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you have calculated on the theory that the probabilities
are independent, whereas they are interdependent.
In the algebra of love this is the typical class of probabilities.
The two events&mdash;your falling in love with me,
my falling in love with you&mdash;are related; they are not
absolutely isolated phenomena as you have superficially
assumed. It is our common qualities which make us
gravitate together, and what makes me love you is the
same thing that makes you love me. Thus the odds

against our loving each other are immensely less than you
have ciphered out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lillie had fallen back, huddled up, in her corner of the
carriage, her face covered with her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive me,&quot; said Lord Silverdale penitently. &quot;I
had no right to correct your mathematics on your wedding-day.
Say two and two are six and I will make it so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two and two are not six and you know it,&quot; said Lillie
firmly, raising her wet face. &quot;It is I who have to ask forgiveness
for being so cruel to you. But if I have sinned,
I have sinned in ignorance. You will believe that,
dearest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe anything that comes from my Rainbow&#39;s
lips,&quot; said Lord Silverdale. &quot;Why, they are quite white!
Let me kiss them rosy again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Like a naughty child that has been chastened by affliction
she held up her face obediently to meet his. The
lips were already blushing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But confess,&quot; she said, while an arch indefinable
light came into the brown eyes, &quot;confess we have had
a most original courtship.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up
paragraphs and so that they are next to the text they illustrate. Thus
the page number of the illustration might not match the page number in
the List of Illustrations, and the order of illustrations may not be the
same in the List of Illustrations and in the book.</p>
